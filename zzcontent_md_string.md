122-75 Consequences for the company (creation case)

#### When is a roll-over available

##### 122-15  Disposal or creation of assets—wholly-owned company

If you are an individual or a trustee, you can choose to obtain a
roll-over if one of the * CGT events (the **_trigger event_** ) specified in
this table happens involving you and a company in the
circumstances set out in sections 122-20 to 122-35.

**Relevant** ***** **CGT events**

**Event No.** **What you do**

A1 * Dispose of a CGT asset, or all the assets of a business, to the
company

D1 Create contractual or other rights in the company

D2 Grant an option to the company

D3 Grant the company a right to income from mining

F1 Grant a lease to the company, or renew or extend a lease

Note 1: The roll-over starts at section 122-40.

Note 2: Section 103-25 tells you when you have to make the choice.

Note 3: A roll-over may also be available under Subdivision 328-G
(Restructures of small businesses).

Example: Gavin runs a plumbing business. He wants to incorporate it so he
disposes of all its assets to a company. He becomes the sole
shareholder of the company.

##### 122-20  What you receive for the trigger event

(1) The consideration you receive for the trigger event happening must
be only:

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-3** Capital gains and losses: special topics
**Division 122** Roll-over for the disposal of assets to, or the creation of assets in, a
wholly-owned company

##### Section 122-25

(b) for a * disposal of a * CGT asset, or all the assets of a business,
to the company (a **_disposal case_** )—shares in the company
and the company undertaking to discharge one or more
liabilities in respect of the asset or assets of the * business (as
appropriate).

Note: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an
asset: see section 122-37.

(2) The * shares cannot be * redeemable shares.

(3) The * market value of the * shares you receive for the trigger event
happening must be substantially the same as:

(a) for a disposal case—the market value of the asset or assets
you disposed of, less any liabilities the company undertakes
to discharge in respect of the asset or assets (as appropriate);
or

(b) for another trigger event (a **_creation case_** )—the market value
of the CGT asset created in the company (the **_created asset_** ).

(4) In working out if the requirement in paragraph (3)(a) is satisfied, if
the * market value of the * shares is different to what it would
otherwise be only because of the possibility of liabilities attaching
to the asset or assets, disregard the difference.

Note: The company may have to pay income tax if an amount is included in
its assessable income because of a CGT event happening to an asset
you disposed of, or it may have a liability because of accrued leave
entitlements of employees. The market value of the shares will reflect
these contingent liabilities.

##### 122-25  Other requirements to be satisfied

(1) You must own all the * shares in the company just after the time of
the trigger event.

Note: You must own the shares in the same capacity as you owned or
created the assets that the company now owns.

(2) This Subdivision does not apply to the * disposal or creation of any
of the assets specified in this table:

#### When is a roll-over available

##### 122-125  Disposal or creation of assets—wholly-owned company

All of the partners in a partnership can choose to obtain a roll-over
if one of the * CGT events (the **_trigger event_** ) specified in this table
happens involving the partners and a company in the circumstances
set out in sections 122-130 to 122-140.

**Relevant** ***** **CGT events**

**Event No.** **What the partners do**

A1 * Dispose of their interests in a * CGT asset of the partnership, or
all the assets of a business carried on by the partnership, to the
company

D1 Create contractual or other rights in the company

D2 Grant an option to the company

D3 Grant the company a right to income from mining

F1 Grant a lease to the company, or renew or extend a lease

Note 1: The roll-over starts at section 122-150.

Note 2: Section 103-25 tells you when you have to make the choice.

Example: Michael and Sandra operate a fish shop in partnership. They agree to
incorporate the business so they dispose of their interests in all its
assets to a company. They are the only shareholders of the company.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: special topics **Part 3-3**

Roll-over for the disposal of assets to, or the creation of assets in, a wholly-owned
company **Division 122**

##### Section 122-130

##### 122-130  What the partners receive for the trigger event

(1) The consideration the partners receive must be only:

(a)  * shares in the company; or

(b) for a * disposal of their interests in a * CGT asset, or in all the
assets of a business, to the company (a **_disposal case_** )—
shares in the company and the company undertaking to
discharge one or more liabilities in respect of their interests.

Note: There are rules for working out what are the liabilities in respect of an
interest in an asset: see section 122-145.

(2) The * shares cannot be * redeemable shares.

(3) The * market value of the * shares each partner receives for the
trigger event happening must be substantially the same as:

(a) for a disposal case—the market value of the interests in the
asset or assets the partner disposed of, less any liabilities the
company undertakes to discharge in respect of the interests in
the asset or assets (as appropriate); or

(b) for another trigger event (a **_creation case_** )—the market value
of what would have been the partner’s interest in the * CGT
asset created in the company (the **_created asset_** ) if it were an
asset of the partnership.

(4) In working out if the requirement in paragraph (3)(a) is satisfied, if
the * market value of the * shares is different to what it would
otherwise be only because of the possibility of liabilities attaching
to the asset or assets, disregard the difference.

Note: The company may have to pay income tax if an amount is included in
its assessable income because of a CGT event happening to an asset a
partner disposed of, or it may have a liability because of accrued leave
entitlements of employees. The market value of the shares will reflect
these contingent liabilities.

##### 122-135  Other requirements to be satisfied

(1) The partners must own all the * shares in the company just after the
time of the trigger event.

trigger event happening in the same capacity that the partner:

now owns; or

conduct (except if a partner paid money or
gave any other property for it); or

(c) an asset that becomes * trading stock of the
company just after the disposal or creation
(unless it was trading stock of the
partnership when it was disposed of)

(4) If:

(a) the * CGT asset or any of the assets of the * business is a right,
option, * convertible interest or * exchangeable interest; and

(b) the company * acquires another CGT asset by exercising the

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: special topics **Part 3-3**

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-1

#### Guide to Division 124

##### 124-1  What this Division is about

A replacement-asset roll-over allows you, in special cases, to defer
the making of a capital gain or loss from one CGT event until a
later CGT event happens. It involves your ownership of one CGT
asset ending and you acquiring another one.

##### 124-5  How to find your way around this Division

(1) First, find out if you can obtain a roll-over when your ownership of
one or more CGT assets ends and you acquire one or more CGT
assets: see Subdivisions 124-B to 124-R.

Note: If you carry on a small business, you may also be able to obtain a
roll-over under Subdivision 152-E.

(2) Second, find out what the consequences are for being able to obtain
a roll-over: see Subdivision 124-A.

Note: The consequences of a scrip for scrip roll-over are set out in
Subdivision 124-M. The consequences of replacing a statutory licence
by a new statutory licence are set out in Subdivision 124-C. The
consequences of an exchange of a membership interest in an MDO are
set out in Subdivision 124-P. The consequences of an exchange of
stapled ownership interests are set out in Subdivision 124-Q. The
consequences of a roll-over for water entitlements are set out in
Subdivision 124-R.

(3) Third, find out if there are any special rules relevant to your
situation: see the Subdivision under which you can get the
roll-over.

#### Subdivision 124-A—General rules

##### Table of sections

124-10 Your ownership of one CGT asset ends

124-15 Your ownership of more than one CGT asset ends

##### Section 124-10

124-20 Share and interest sale facilities

##### 124-10  Your ownership of one CGT asset ends

(1) There are these consequences (in most cases) if you can obtain a
roll-over when your ownership of a * CGT asset (the **_original asset_** )
ends and you * acquire one or more CGT assets (the **_new assets_** ) in
a situation covered by this Division.

(1A) A * car, motor cycle or similar vehicle must not be one of the new
assets.

(2) A * capital gain or a * capital loss you make from the original asset
is disregarded.

(3) If you * acquired the original asset on or after 20 September 1985,
the first element of each new asset’s __ * cost base is:

The original asset’s cost base

(worked out when your ownership of it ended)

Number of new assets

The first element of each new asset’s __ * reduced cost base is worked
out similarly.

Note 1: In some cases the amount you paid to acquire the new asset also forms
part of the first element: see Subdivision 124-D (about strata title
conversion).

Note 2: There are modifications to the consequences in Subdivision 124-B
(about compulsory acquisition, loss or destruction),
Subdivision 124-C (about statutory licences), Subdivision 124-J
(about Crown leases) and Subdivision 124-L (about prospecting and
mining).

Note 3: No other elements of the cost base of the new asset are affected by the
roll-over.

Note 4: There are special indexation rules for roll-overs: see Division 114.

Note 5: The reduced cost base may be modified for a roll-over happening after
a demerger: see section 125-170.

(4) If you * acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985, you
are taken to have acquired each new asset before that day.

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-15

Note: A capital gain or loss you make from a CGT asset you acquired before
20 September 1985 is generally disregarded: see Division 104. This

(5) However, subsection (4) is taken never to have applied to a * share
to which subsection 104-195(6) applies (CGT event J4).

##### 124-15  Your ownership of more than one CGT asset ends

(1) There are these consequences (in most cases) if you can obtain a
roll-over when your ownership of more than one * CGT asset (the
**_original assets_** ) ends and you acquire one or more CGT assets (the
**_new assets_** ) in a situation covered by this Division.

Example: You own 100 shares in a company. The company cancels these shares

(1A) A * car, motor cycle or similar vehicle must not be one of the new
assets.

(2) A * capital gain or a * capital loss you make from each original asset __
is disregarded.

(3) If you * acquired all the original assets on or after 20 September

The total of the cost bases of all the original assets

(worked out when your ownership of them ended)

Number of new assets

The first element of each new asset’s __ * reduced cost base is worked

**Part 3-3** Capital gains and losses: special topics
**Division 124** Replacement-asset roll-overs

##### Section 124-15

(5) If you * acquired some of the original assets before 20 September
1985, you are taken to have acquired a number of new assets
before that day. It is the maximum possible that does not exceed:

The number of original assets you

*acquired before 20 September 1985
The number of new assets
The total number of original assets


If the result is less than one, none of the new assets are taken to
have been * acquired before 20 September 1985.

Example: To continue the example, suppose you acquired 67 of the 100 original
shares before 20 September 1985. The number of new shares that you
are taken to have acquired before that day cannot exceed:

67
10 6.7
100
 

So, you are taken to have acquired 6 of the 10 shares before that day.

(6) These rules are relevant to each remaining new asset. The first
element of each one’s * cost base is:

The total of the cost bases of all the original assets

that you *acquired on or after 20 September 1985

(worked out when your ownership of them ended)

Number of remaining new assets

The first element of each one’s __ * reduced cost base is worked out
similarly.

Note: There are special indexation rules for roll-overs: see Division 114.

Example: To continue the example, suppose the total of the cost bases of the 33
shares you acquired on or after 20 September 1985 is $400.

The first element of the cost base of each of the remaining 4 shares is:

$400
$100
4


The first element of the reduced cost base of those 4 shares is worked
out similarly.

##### 124-20  Share and interest sale facilities

_Share and interest sale facilities_

(1) An entity (the **_investor_** ) is treated as owning an * ownership interest
(the **_roll-over interest_** ) in a company or trust (the **_issuer_** ) at a time

(a) the investor owned an ownership interest (the **_original_**
**_interest_** ) in a company or trust; and

(b) a transaction happened in relation to the original interest; and

(c) because:

(i) a * foreign law impedes the ability of the issuer to issue
or transfer the roll-over interest to the investor; or

(ii) it would be impractical or unreasonably onerous to
determine whether a foreign law impedes the ability of
the issuer to issue or transfer the roll-over interest to the
investor;

it is * arranged that the issuer will issue or transfer the
roll-over interest to another entity (the **_facility_** ) under the
transaction instead of to the investor; and

(d) in accordance with that arrangement and as a result of the
transaction, the facility:

(i) becomes the owner of the roll-over interest; and

(ii) owns the roll-over interest at the deeming time; and

(e) under the arrangement, the investor is entitled to receive from
the facility:

(i) an amount equivalent to the * capital proceeds of any
* CGT event that happens in relation to the roll-over
interest (less expenses); or

(ii) if a CGT event happens in relation to the roll-over
interest together with CGT events __ happening in relation
to other ownership interests—an amount equivalent to

consequences if you choose to obtain a roll-over.

_Original asset acquired on or after 20 September 1985_

(2) If you make a * capital gain from the event, this table sets out in
what situations the gain is reduced, not reduced or disregarded.

It also sets out in what situations the expenditure you incurred to
* acquire another * CGT asset or to repair or restore the original
asset is reduced.

**You make a capital gain from the event**

**Item** **In this situation:** **There are these consequences**

1 The money exceeds the expenditure
you incurred to * acquire another
CGT asset or to repair or restore the
original asset

If the gain is more than the excess:
(a) the gain is reduced to the amount
by which the money exceeds that
expenditure; and

(b) that expenditure is reduced by the
amount by which the gain (before
it is reduced) is more than the
excess

2 The money exceeds that
expenditure

If the gain is less than or equal to the
excess, the gain is not reduced

**Division 124** Replacement-asset roll-overs

##### Section 124-85

**You make a capital gain from the event**

**Item** **In this situation:** **There are these consequences**

3 The money does not exceed that
expenditure

The gain is disregarded in working
out your * net capital gain or * net
capital loss for the income year. That
expenditure is reduced by the amount
of the gain

Example: In 1999 Simon bought a small factory. In 2000 a fire destroys part of
it. He receives $100,000 under an insurance policy.

The capital gain is worked out under section 112-30.

Suppose the factory’s cost base at the time of the fire is $75,000 and
the market value of the part that is not destroyed is $150,000. The cost
base of the part that is destroyed is:

$100,000
$75,000 $30,000
$100,000 $150,000
 


The capital gain is:

$100,000 – $30,000 $70,000 

Case 1

Suppose Simon spent $80,000 on repairing the factory. The money he
received under the insurance policy exceeds the repair cost by
$20,000. The gain exceeds that by $50,000.

The result is that the gain is reduced to $20,000 and the $80,000 he
spent on repairs is reduced to $30,000.

Case 2

Suppose Simon spent $15,000 on repairs instead. The money he
received under the policy exceeds that amount by $85,000. This is
more than the gain he made.

The gain is relevant to working out Simon’s net capital gain or loss for
the income year and the $15,000 he spent on repairs forms part of the
factory’s cost base.

Case 3

Suppose Simon spent $120,000 on repairs instead. The gain is
disregarded and the $120,000 is reduced to $50,000.

Capital gains and losses: special topics **Part 3-3**

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-90

_Original asset acquired before 20 September 1985_

(3) If you * acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985 and
you incurred expenditure in acquiring another * CGT asset, you are
taken to have acquired the other asset before that day if:

(a) the expenditure is not more than 120% of the * market value
of the original asset when the event happened; or

(b) a natural disaster happened so that the original asset, or part
of it, is lost or destroyed and it is reasonable to treat the other
asset as substantially the same as the original asset.

(4) If you * acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985 and
you incurred expenditure of a capital nature in repairing or
restoring it, you are taken to have acquired the original asset (as
repaired or restored) before that day.

##### 124-90  Consequences for receiving an asset

(1) If you receive another * CGT asset for the event happening, there
are these consequences if you choose to obtain a roll-over.

(2) A * capital gain you make from the original asset is disregarded.

(3) If you * acquired the original asset on or after 20 September 1985:

(a) the first element of the other asset’s * cost base is the original
asset’s cost base at the time of the event; and

(b) the first element of the other asset’s * reduced cost base is the
original asset’s reduced cost base at the time of the event.

Note: There are special indexation rules for roll-overs: see Division 114.

Example: Steven bought land in 1999 for $100,000. In 2001 the government
compulsorily acquires the land and gives him new land in return.

A capital gain he makes from the original land is disregarded. Suppose
the original land’s cost base when it is acquired is $120,000. The first
element of the new land’s cost base becomes $120,000.

(4) If you acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985, you
are taken to have * acquired the other asset before that day.

**Part 3-3** Capital gains and losses: special topics
**Division 124** Replacement-asset roll-overs

##### Section 124-95

##### 124-95  You receive both money and an asset

(1) If you receive both money and another * CGT asset for the event
happening and choose to obtain a roll-over, the requirements and
consequences are different for each part of the compensation
attributable to the original asset (having regard to the amount of
money and the * market value of the other asset).

_The other asset as a part of compensation_

(2) The * market value of the other asset (when you * acquire it) must be
more than that part of the * cost base of the original asset that is
attributable to the new asset.

Note: This requirement is different to that in subsection 124-80(3). It
requires a proportional attribution of the cost base of the
original asset.

(3) If you * acquired the original asset on or after 20 September 1985:

(a) the first element of the other asset’s * cost base is that
part of the original asset’s cost base at the time of the
event that is attributable to the new asset; and

(b) the first element of the other asset’s * reduced cost base
is worked out similarly.

Note: These consequences are different to those in
subsection 124-90(3). They require a proportional attribution
of the cost base of the original asset.

(4) If you * acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985, you
are taken to have acquired the new asset before that day.

_Money as a part of compensation_

(5) If you make a * capital gain from the event, this table sets out in
what situations that part of the gain on the original asset that is
attributable to the amount of money you received is reduced, not
reduced or disregarded.

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-95

It also sets out in what situations the expenditure you incurred to
* acquire another * CGT asset or to repair or restore the original
asset is reduced.

**You make a capital gain from the event**

**Item** **In this situation:** **There are these consequences**

1 The money exceeds the expenditure
you incurred to * acquire another
CGT asset or to repair or restore the
original asset

If that part of the gain that is
attributable to the amount of money is
more than the excess:
(a) that part of the gain is reduced to
the amount by which the money
exceeds that expenditure; and

(b) that expenditure is reduced by the
amount by which that part of the
gain (before it is reduced) is more
than the excess

2 The money exceeds that
expenditure

If that part of the gain that is
attributable to the amount of money is
less than or equal to the excess, the
gain is not reduced

3 The money does not exceed that
expenditure

That part of the gain that is
attributable to the amount of money is
disregarded in working out your * net
capital gain or * net capital loss for the
income year. That expenditure is
reduced by the amount of that part of
the gain

Note: These consequences are different to those in
subsection 124-85(2). They require a proportional attribution
of capital gain on the original asset.

(6) If you * acquired the original asset before 20 September 1985 and
you incurred expenditure in acquiring another * CGT asset, you are
taken to have acquired the other asset before that day if:

(a) the expenditure you incurred in acquiring the other
asset is not more than 120% of the * market value of

that part of the original asset that is attributable to the
other asset when the event happened; or

(b) a natural disaster happened so that the original asset, or
part of it, is lost or destroyed and it is reasonable to
treat the other asset as substantially the same as that
part of the original asset that is attributable to the new
asset.

Note 1: The consequences in paragraph (6)(a) are different to those in
paragraph 124-85(3)(a). They require a proportional
attribution of the market value of the original asset.

Note 2: The consequences in paragraph (6)(b) are different to those in
paragraph 124-85(3)(b). They require a proportional
attribution of the original asset.

Example: Kris owns land, which he acquired in 1998. It is compulsorily
acquired, and Kris receives $80,000 in cash and replacement
land with a market value of $80,000.

The cost base of the original land is $150,000.

Kris buys additional land for $80,000.

Subsection (2) is satisfied because the market value of the
replacement land ($80,000) is more than the part of the cost
base of the original land that is attributable to the replacement
land:

50% $150,000 $75,000  

Applying subsection (5), the other part of the gain is
disregarded, and the first element of the cost base of the
replacement land is the part of the cost base of the original
land that is attributable to the replacement land:

50% $150,000 $75,000  

Applying subsection (3), the money he received ($80,000) is
the same as the expenditure he incurred to buy the additional
land. Item 3 in the table applies. The part of the gain that is
attributable to that money is disregarded:

50% $10,000 $5,000  

The expenditure is reduced by $5,000.

(1A) If:

(a) you are a foreign resident just before the * CGT event
happens (or just before one or more of the CGT events
happens); or

(b) you are the trustee of a trust that is a * foreign trust for CGT
purposes for the income year in which the event happens (or
for an income year in which one or more of those events

##### Section 124-580

(g) by excising or relinquishing a part of the land to which the
original right related; or

(h) by expanding the area of that land.

##### 124-580  Meaning of **_Crown lease_**

A **_Crown lease_** is:

(a) a lease of land granted by the Crown under an * Australian
law (other than the common law); or

(b) a similar lease granted under a * foreign law.

##### 124-585  Original right differs in area from new right

(1) Even if the new right relates to different land to that to which the
original right related, this Subdivision applies as if it relates to the
same land in these cases:

(a) the difference in area is not significant;

(b) the difference in * market value is not significant;

(c) the new right was granted to correct errors in or omissions
from the original right;

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-595

(b) you received a payment for the expiry or surrender of the
original right.

The payment can include giving property: see section 103-5.

Note: Section 124-600 sets out the effect on your cost base.

(2) There is no roll-over for the excised part. The * cost base of the
excised part is so much of the * cost base of the relevant * Crown
lease as is attributable to the excised part.

Its * reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

Note: You may make a capital gain or loss on the excised part because of
CGT event C2.

##### 124-595  Treating parts of new right as separate assets

(1) Each part of a * Crown lease or an estate in fee simple that is part of
the new right is taken to be a separate * CGT asset to the extent that
it relates to:

(a) land to which a Crown lease (that was part of the original
right) related where you * acquired the lease before
20 September 1985; and

(b) land to which a Crown lease (that was part of the original
right) related where you acquired the lease on or after
20 September 1985; and

(c) other land.

(2) You are taken to have * acquired each asset that is a separate * CGT
asset because of paragraph (1)(a) before 20 September 1985.

##### 124-600  What is the roll-over?

(1) The roll-over is mainly as specified in Subdivision 124-A.

(2) However, you work out the * cost base and * reduced cost base of
* CGT assets (that you are not taken to have * acquired before
20 September 1985) and that are part of the new right a bit
differently where section 124-590 or 124-595 applies.

##### Section 124-605

(3) The first element of your * cost base for each of those assets is:

Market value of separate asset
CB of post-CGT original right
Market value of all new assets


where:

**_CB of post-CGT original right_** is the sum of the * cost bases of the
* Crown leases (that were part of the original right) and that you
* acquired on or after 20 September 1985 (just before the original
right expired or was surrendered) reduced, if there is an excised
part, by so much of those cost bases as is attributable to the excised
part.

**_market value of all new assets_** is the * market value of all * CGT
assets (that you are not taken to have * acquired before
20 September 1985) that are part of the new right just after you
acquired them.

**_market value of separate asset_** is the * market value of the
particular asset just after you * acquired it.

(4) The first element of the * reduced cost base of each of those assets
is worked out similarly.

##### 124-605  Change of lessor

(1) You treat a lease of land (whether or not it is a * Crown lease)
granted to you (the **_fresh lease_** ) as being a renewal of your original
right if:

(a) after the grant of the original right, the land (the **_original_**
**_land_** ) to which it related became vested in an * Australian
government agency (other than the one that granted the
original right); and

(b) the second agency granted you the fresh lease over:

(i) the original land; or

(ii) the original land less an excised area; or

(iii) the original land and other land; and

124-655 Roll-over for depreciating assets

124-660 Right granted to associate

##### 124-655  Roll-over for depreciating assets

There is a roll-over for a * depreciating asset if:

(a) the asset is attached to land you hold under a
* quasi-ownership right granted by an * exempt Australian
government agency or an * exempt foreign government
agency; and

(b) you * hold the asset because of section 40-40; and

(c) the quasi-ownership right expires or is terminated or you
surrender it; and

(d) you are granted a new quasi-ownership right over the land or
an estate in fee simple in the land; and

(e) there is no roll-over for you under Subdivision 124-J (about
Crown leases) or Subdivision 124-L (about prospecting and
mining entitlements).

Note 1: The roll-over consequences are set out in Subdivision 124-A.

Note 2: This section provides a roll-over for a depreciating asset in the limited
circumstances where Subdivision 124-J cannot because a
quasi-ownership right over land covers situations that a Crown lease
does not (for example, an easement over land).

Note 3: If there has been a capital improvement to the quasi-ownership right:

(a) you hold one or more * CGT assets that are * prospecting
entitlements or * mining entitlements (the **_original_**
**_entitlement_** ); and

(b) the original entitlement expires or you surrender it; and

(c) you are granted one or more new prospecting entitlements or
mining entitlements (the **_new entitlement_** ); and

(d) the new entitlement relates to the same land as the original
entitlement.

Note 1: The roll-over consequences are set out in Subdivision 124-A. They
might be modified: see section 124-730.

Note 2: If there has been a capital improvement to the entitlement: see
section 108-75.

(2) The new entitlement must have been granted in one of these ways:

(a) by renewing or extending the term of the original entitlement
where the renewal or extension is mainly due to your having
held the original entitlement; or

(b) by consolidating, or consolidating and dividing, the original
entitlement; or

(c) by subdividing the original entitlement; or

(d) by converting a * prospecting entitlement to a * mining
entitlement, or a mining entitlement to a prospecting

**Division 124** Replacement-asset roll-overs

##### Section 124-715

(b) a lease of land that allows the lessee to prospect or explore
for minerals or geothermal energy resources on the land; or

(c) an interest in a thing referred to in paragraph (a), (aa) or (b).

(2) A **_mining entitlement_** is:

(a) an authority, licence, permit or entitlement under an
* Australian law or * foreign law to mine for * minerals in an

##### 124-715  Original entitlement differs in area from new entitlement

(1) Even if the new entitlement relates to different land to that to
which the original entitlement related, this Subdivision applies as if
it relates to the same land in these cases:

(a) the difference in area is not significant;

because a part (the **_excised part_** ) of the land to which the
original entitlement related was excised or you relinquished
it; and

(b) you received a payment for the expiry or surrender of the
original entitlement.

The payment can include giving property: see section 103-5.

Note: Section 124-730 sets out the effect on your cost base.

(2) There is no roll-over for the excised part. The * cost base of the
excised part is so much of the * cost base of the original entitlement
as is attributable to the excised part.

Its * reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

Note: You may make a capital gain or loss on the excised part because of
CGT event C2.

##### 124-725  Treating parts of new entitlement as separate assets

(1) Each part of a * prospecting entitlement or * mining entitlement that
is part of the new entitlement is taken to be a separate * CGT asset
to the extent that it relates to:

(a) land to which a prospecting entitlement or mining entitlement
(that was part of the original entitlement) related where you
* acquired the entitlement before 20 September 1985; and

(b) land to which a prospecting entitlement or mining entitlement
(that was part of the original entitlement) related where you
acquired the entitlement on or after 20 September 1985; and

(c) other land.

(2) You are taken to have * acquired each asset that is a separate * CGT
asset because of paragraph (1)(a) before 20 September 1985.

##### 124-730  What is the roll-over?

(1) The roll-over is mainly as specified in Subdivision 124-A.

(2) However, you work out the * cost base and * reduced cost base of
* CGT assets (that you are not taken to have * acquired before

differently where section 124-720 or 124-725 applies.

(3) The first element of your * cost base for each of those assets is:

Market value of separate asset
CB of post-CGT original entitlement
Market value of all new assets

where:

**_CB of post-CGT original entitlement_** is the sum of the * cost bases
of the prospecting entitlements or mining entitlements (that were
part of the original entitlement) and that you * acquired on or after
20 September 1985 (just before the original entitlement expired or
was surrendered) reduced, if there is an excised part, by so much of
those cost bases as is attributable to the excised part.

**_market value of all new assets_** is the * market value of all * CGT
assets (that you are not taken to have * acquired before
20 September 1985) that are part of the new entitlement just after
you acquired them.

**_market value of separate asset_** is the * market value of the
particular asset just after you * acquired it.

(4) The first element of the * reduced cost base of each of those assets
is worked out similarly.

Note 3: A trustee who gets a roll-over under this Subdivision for an original
interest consisting of shares issued as part of a demutualisation may be
eligible for a further roll-over under Subdivision 126-E when a
beneficiary becomes absolutely entitled to the replacement shares.

Example 1:You can get a roll-over if you exchange your shares in one entity for
shares in another entity or if you exchange options in one entity for
options in another entity. You cannot get a roll-over if you exchange
options for shares.

Example 2:Examples of arrangements that could be involved include:

- a company takeover, whether or not it is regulated by the
_Corporations Act 2001_ , resulting in a company owning 80% or
more of another company’s shares.

- a scheme of arrangement governed by the _Corporations Act 2001_ 
that involves a cancellation of some interests in an original entity
resulting in another entity owning 80% or more of the interests in
the original entity.

_Conditions for arrangement_

(2) The * arrangement must:

(a) result in:

(i) a company (the **_acquiring entity_** ) that is not a member
of a * wholly-owned group becoming the owner of 80%
or more of the * voting shares in the original entity; or

(ii) a company (also an **_acquiring entity_** ) that is a member

Capital gains and losses: special topics **Part 3-3**

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-782

(a) original interests of an original interest holder are cancelled
under the arrangement; and

(b) the holder obtains a roll-over for the cancellation; and

(c) the holder is a * significant stakeholder or a * common
stakeholder for the arrangement.

(3) The first element of the * cost base and * reduced cost base of the
new interests of an acquiring entity is that part of the cost base of
the cancelled interests as can be reasonably allocated to the new
interests, having regard to:

(a) the nature of the * arrangement; and

(b) the number, type and relative * market values of the cancelled
interests and the new interests; and

(c) any other relevant matters.

Example: Robert Co has 3 shareholders: Antill Co with 300 shares, Rachael Co
400 shares and Margaret Co 300 shares. The cost base of each share is
$1 and market value is $2. Margaret Co is owned by two shareholders,
John and Paul, who each have 50 shares. The market value of each
share is $20.

Under an arrangement, Robert Co cancels the shares of Antill Co and
Rachael Co. They receive 30 and 40 shares respectively in Margaret
Co, which becomes the sole shareholder in Robert Co. The market
value of Antill Co’s and Rachael Co’s shares in Margaret Co is
equivalent to the market value of their cancelled shares in Robert Co.

Robert Co also issues 700 shares to Margaret Co, reflecting the $1,400
total market value of the shares issued by Margaret Co to Antill Co
and Rachael Co. Before and after the arrangement, Margaret Co’s
shares in Robert Co were worth $2 each.

It is necessary to reasonably allocate the cost bases of the cancelled
shares (700 x $1) to the 700 shares issued by Robert Co to Margaret
Co. In this case, an allocation of $1 per share would be reasonable.

Note: If no new shares are issued by Robert Co, the cost base of the original
shares that Margaret Co holds would not be adjusted.

(4) The amount allocated to a new interest under subsection (3) must
not be more than its * market value just after the * arrangement was
completed.

Example: There are 4 shareholders in YZT Company: Sonja has 60%, Mario has
20%, Peter has 10% and Dave has 10%.

Sonja, Mario and Peter are associates. They each have a significant
stake in YZT because, on an associate inclusive basis, they each have
a 90% stake in YZT. Dave does not have a significant stake because
his total stake, on an associate inclusive basis, is 10%.

(7) An entity has a **_significant stake_** in a trust at a time if the entity, or
the entity and the entity’s * associates between them, had at that
time the right to receive 30% or more of any distribution to

entity would need to receive if it were to dispose,
at the completion time, of those assets without an
amount being assessable income of, or deductible
to, the original entity; and

(d) the amount worked out under steps 2 and 3.

Step 2. For the original entity’s * trading stock, add up:

(a) the * value of the trading stock at the start of the

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: special topics **Part 3-3**

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-784B

(c) the amount of any outgoing incurred in connection
with acquiring an item of trading stock during that
income year but before the completion time
(except live stock acquired by natural increase);
and

(d) the amount of any outgoings forming part of the
cost of the trading stock incurred by the entity
during its current holding of the trading stock but
before the completion time.

Step 3. For any asset of the original entity not covered by steps 1
and 2, work out the amount that would be the asset’s
* cost base at the completion time if it were a * CGT asset.

Step 4. Subtract from the result of step 1 the original entity’s
liabilities (if any) at the completion time in respect of
those assets.

Step 5. If there is one class of * membership interests in the
original entity, divide the result of step 4 by the total
number of those membership interests at the completion
time.

If there are 2 or more classes of membership interests in
the original entity, allocate a portion of the result of step
4 to each class in proportion to the * market value of all
the membership interests in that class and divide that
result by the total number of membership interests in that
class at the completion time.

Note 1: For the purposes of this subsection, Division 701 (Core rules for
consolidated groups) is disregarded for an original entity that becomes
a subsidiary member of a consolidated group or MEC group under the
arrangement (see paragraph 715-910(1)(a)).

Note 2: If the original entity is the head company of a consolidated group or
MEC group, then subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule) and
section 701-5 (the entry history rule) apply in relation to that group
when working out steps 1 and 2 (see subsection 715-910(2)).

##### Section 124-784B

Note 3: For step 5, the replacement entity may choose to use the officially
quoted price of the qualifying interests as their market value (see
subsection 124-784A(3)).

_First element of cost base—interests acquired in exchange for_
_replacement interests and cash etc._

(3) However, if the qualifying interest was acquired under the
* arrangement partly in exchange for one or more replacement
interests and partly for something else, subsection (2) applies only
for working out the first element of that part of the * cost base of the
qualifying interest that is attributable to the replacement interests.

Note 1: This means that the acquiring entity will have to apportion the cost
base amount worked out under subsection (2) according to the relative
values of the replacement interests and the other component.

Note 2: The first element of that part of the cost base, and reduced cost base,
of the qualifying interest that is attributable to cash etc. is worked out
using the general rules about cost base.

_Liabilities_

(4) For the purposes of step 4 of subsection (2), a liability of the
original entity that is not a liability in respect of a specific asset or
assets of the entity is taken to be a liability in respect of all the
assets of the entity.

(5) If a liability is in respect of 2 or more assets, the proportion of the
liability that is in respect of any one of those assets is equal to:

*

The market value of the asset

*

The total of the market values of all the

assets that the liability is in respect of

_First element of reduced cost base_

(6) The first element of the * reduced cost base of the acquiring entity
for the qualifying interest in the original entity is worked out
similarly.

_Rights and options to acquire membership interests_

(7) For the purposes of step 5 of subsection (2), if at the completion
time a person holds an option, right or similar interest (including a
contingent option, right or interest), created or issued by the
original entity, to acquire a * membership interest in the original
entity, that option, right or interest is treated as if it were a

_Purpose_

(1) This section allocates an appropriate * cost base to equity issued, or
new debt owed, under the * arrangement by a member of a
* wholly-owned group to another member (the **_holder_** ) of the group,
if:

(a) an acquiring entity is a member of the group; and

(b) the cost base of the acquiring entity for a qualifying interest
was worked out under section 124-784B.

_Allocation of cost base_

(2) The first element of the * cost base of the equity or debt for the
holder is that part of the cost base of the qualifying interest worked
out under section 124-784B as:

(a) may be reasonably allocated to the equity or debt; and

(b) is not more than the * market value of the equity or debt at the
completion time.

##### 124-785  What is the roll-over?

(1) A * capital gain you make from your original interest is disregarded.

(2) You work out the first element of the * cost base of each * CGT
asset you received as a result of the exchange by reasonably
attributing to it the cost base (or the part of it) of your original

(3) In applying subsection (2), you reduce the * cost base of your
original interest (just before you stop owning it) by so much of that
cost base as is attributable to an ineligible part (see
section 124-790).

(4) The first element of the * reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

Example 2:Glenn exchanges 2 shares with cost bases of $10 and $11 respectively
for one new share. The cost base of the new share is $21.

Example 3:Wayne exchanges 1 share with a cost base of $9 for share A with a
market value of $5 and share B with a market value of $10. The cost
base of share A is $3 and the cost base of share B is $6.

##### 124-790  Partial roll-over

(1) The original interest holder can obtain only a partial roll-over if its
* capital proceeds for its original interest include something (the
**_ineligible proceeds_** ) other than its replacement interest. There is no
roll-over for that part (the **_ineligible part_** ) of its original interest for
which it received ineligible proceeds.

(2) The * cost base of the ineligible part is that part of the cost base of
your original interest as is reasonably attributable to it.

Example: Ken owns 100 shares in Aim Ltd. Those shares have a cost base of $2.

Ken accepts an offer from LBZ Ltd to acquire those shares. The offer
is 1 share in LBZ (market value $4) plus $1 for each Aim share.

Ken chooses the roll-over to the extent that he can.

The cost base of the ineligible part is [$100  $200]  $500  $40.

Ken makes a capital gain of $100  $40  $60.

Capital gains and losses: special topics **Part 3-3**

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-795

##### 124-795  Exceptions

(1) You cannot obtain the roll-over if, just before you stop owning
your original interest, you are a foreign resident unless, just after
you * acquire your replacement interest, the replacement interest is
* taxable Australian property.

(2) You cannot obtain the roll-over if:

(a) any * capital gain you might make from your replacement
interest would be disregarded (except because of a roll-over);
or

(b) you and the acquiring entity are members of the same
* wholly-owned group just before you stop owning your
original interest and the acquiring entity is a foreign resident.

Example: An example of a capital gain or loss being disregarded as mentioned
in paragraph (2)(a) is because the asset is trading stock.

Note: A roll-over may be available under Subdivision 126-B in the
circumstances mentioned in paragraph (2)(b).

(3) You cannot obtain the roll-over for the * CGT event happening in
relation to the exchange of your original interest if you can choose
a roll-over under Division 122 or 615 for that event.

Note: Division 122 deals with the disposal of assets to a wholly-owned
company, and Division 615 deals with business restructures.

(4) You cannot obtain the roll-over for the * CGT event happening in
relation to the exchange of your qualifying interest if:

(a) the replacement entity makes a choice to that effect under
this subsection; and

(b) that entity or the original entity notifies you in writing of the
choice before the exchange.

##### 124-800  Interest received for pre-CGT interest

**Division 124** Replacement-asset roll-overs

##### Section 124-810

cost base of the interest in the replacement entity is its * market
value just after you acquired it.

(2) The * cost base and * reduced cost base of the interest in the
replacement entity is reduced if all or part of a * capital gain from
* CGT event K6 happening is disregarded because of
subsection 104-230(10). The amount of the reduction is the amount
of the * capital gain you disregard under that subsection.

Note 1: The full list of CGT events is in section 104-5.

Note 2: Subsection 104-230(10) provides that a capital gain from CGT event
K6 is disregarded to the extent that you could have chosen a roll-over
under this Subdivision if your original interest had been post-CGT.

##### 124-810  Certain companies and trusts not regarded as having 300
##### members or beneficiaries

(1) For the purposes of this Subdivision, a company is treated as if it

to it.

(2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, a trust is treated as if it did
not have at least 300 beneficiaries if subsection (4) or (5) applies to
it.

_Concentrated ownership_

(3) This subsection applies to a company if an individual owns, or up
to 20 individuals own between them, directly or indirectly (through
one or more interposed entities) and for their own benefit, * shares
in the company:

(a) carrying * fixed entitlements to:

(i) at least 75% of the company’s income; or

(ii) at least 75% of the company’s capital; or

(a) carrying * fixed entitlements to:

(i) at least 75% of the trust’s income; or

(ii) at least 75% of the trust’s capital; or

(b) if beneficiaries of the trust have a right to vote in respect of

rights.

_Possible variation of rights etc._

(5) This subsection applies to a company or trust if, because of:

(a) any provision in the entity’s constituent document, or in any
contract, agreement or instrument:

(i) authorising the variation or abrogation of rights
attaching to any of the * shares, units or other fixed
interests in the entity; or

(b) any contract, * arrangement, option or instrument under which
a person has power to acquire any of those interests; or

(c) any power, authority or discretion in a person in relation to
the rights attaching to any of those shares, units or interests;

it is reasonable to conclude that the rights attaching to any of those
interests are capable of being varied or abrogated in such a way
(even if they are not in fact varied or abrogated in that way) that,
directly or indirectly, subsection (3) or (4) would apply to the
entity.

_Single individual_

(6) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), all of the following are
taken to be a single individual:

(a) an individual, whether or not the individual holds * shares,
units or other interests in the entity concerned;

(b) the individual’s * associates;

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-855

#### Operative provisions

##### 124-855  What this Subdivision deals with

(1) A roll-over may be available for a restructuring (a **_trust_**
**_restructure_** ) if:

(a) a trust, or 2 or more trusts, (the **_transferor_** ) * dispose of all of
their * CGT assets to a company limited by * shares (the
**_transferee_** ); and

(b)  * CGT event E4 is capable of applying to all of the units and
interests in the transferor; and

(c) the requirements in section 124-860 are met.

Note: A roll-over is not available for a restructure undertaken by a
discretionary trust.

(2) For 2 or more transferors, units and interests in each transferor
must be owned in the same proportions by the same beneficiaries.

Example: Matthew and Jaclyn each own 50% of the units in the Spring Unit
Trust and the Dale Unit trust. All of the assets of both trusts are
disposed of to Jonathon Pty Ltd. A roll-over for a trust restructure is
available if the other requirements of this Subdivision are met.

##### 124-860  Requirements for roll-over

(1) All of the * CGT assets owned by the transferor must be disposed of
to the transferee during the * trust restructuring period. However,
ignore any CGT assets retained by the transferor to pay existing or
expected debts of the transferor.

(2) The **_trust restructuring period_** for a trust restructure:

(a) starts just before the first * CGT asset is * disposed of to the
transferee under the trust restructure, which must happen on
or after 11 November 1999; and

(b) ends when the last CGT asset of the transferor is disposed of
to the transferee.

(3) The transferee must not be an * exempt entity.

**Part 3-3** Capital gains and losses: special topics
**Division 124** Replacement-asset roll-overs

##### Section 124-860

(4) The transferee must be a company that:

(a) has never carried on commercial activities; and

(b) has no * CGT assets, other than any or all of the following:

(i) small amounts of cash or debt;

(ii) its rights under an * arrangement, if (collectively) those
rights only facilitate the transfer of assets to the
transferee from the transferor; and

(c) has no losses of any kind.

Example: It could be a shelf company.

(5) Subsection (4) does not apply to a transferee that is the trustee of
the transferor.

(6) Just after the end of the * trust restructuring period:

(a) each entity that owned interests in a transferor just before the
start of the trust restructuring period must own replacement
interests in the transferee in the same proportion as it owned
those interests in that transferor; and

(b) the * market value of the replacement interests each of those
entities owns in the transferee must be at least substantially
the same as the market value of the interests it owned in the
transferor or transferors just before the start of the trust
restructuring period.

Note 1: Any assets in the company just before the start of the trust
restructuring period may affect the ability of owners of units or
interests to comply with paragraph (6)(b).

Note 2: See section 124-20 if an entity uses an interest sale facility.

(7) For the purposes of subsection (6), ignore any * shares in the
transferee that:

(a) just before the start of the * trust restructuring period, were
owned by entities who together owned no more than 5
shares; and

(b) just after the end of that period, represented such a low
percentage of the total * market value of all the shares that it

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-865

is reasonable to treat other entities as if they owned all the
shares in the transferee.

Example: To continue the example in subsection 124-855(2), assume that
Jonathon Pty Ltd was a shelf company organised for Matthew and
Jaclyn by their solicitor, Indira.

Indira owned the 2 shares in Jonathon Pty Ltd before the trust
restructuring period. The company issues Matthew and Jaclyn 5,000
shares each.

In these circumstances, it is reasonable to treat Matthew and Jaclyn as
if they owned all the shares in Jonathon Pty Ltd.

##### 124-865  Entities both choose the roll-over

A roll-over is only available for the transferor and transferee if
both the transferor and transferee choose to obtain it.

Note 1: If they do so, the consequences for the transferor and transferee are set
out in section 124-875.

Note 2: An entity that owns a unit or interest in the transferor can also choose
to obtain a roll-over: see section 124-870.

##### 124-870  Roll-over for owner of units or interests in a trust

(1) You can choose to obtain a roll-over (whether or not the transferor
and transferee choose to obtain a roll-over, and even if * CGT event
J4 applies) if:

(a) you own units or interests in the transferor (your **_original_**
**_interests_** ); and

(b) the ownership of all your units or interests ends under a trust
restructure in exchange for * shares in the transferee (your
**_replacement interests_** ).

Note 1: The roll-over consequences are set out in Subdivision 124-A. The
original assets are your units and interests in the transferor. The new
assets are your shares in the transferee.

Note 2: The effect of the roll-over may be reversed if the transferor does not
cease to exist within 6 months: see section 104-195.

(2) You must make the choice for each of your original interests.

##### Section 124-875

(3) An entity that is a foreign resident cannot choose a roll-over under
this section unless the replacement interests the entity * acquires in
the transferee are * taxable Australian property just after their
acquisition.

(4) If you choose a roll-over, you cannot make a * capital loss from a
* CGT event that happens to your original interests during the * trust
restructuring period.

Note: The rule in subsection (4) prevents a capital loss arising on your units
or interests after the trust assets have been disposed of to the company
but before your shares are issued to you.

_Exception: trading stock_

(5) This section does not apply to your ownership of an original
interest ending if:

(a) the interest was an item of your * trading stock and the
corresponding replacement interest becomes an item of your
trading stock when you * acquire it; or

(b) the interest was not an item of your trading stock but the
corresponding replacement interest becomes an item of your
trading stock when you acquire it.

##### 124-875  Effect on the transferor and transferee

_Capital gains and losses disregarded_

(1) Any * capital gain or * capital loss from * CGT event A1 happening
to the transferor under the trust restructure is disregarded (even if
* CGT event J4 applies).

Note: The effect of the roll-over may be reversed if the transferor does not
cease to exist within 6 months: see section 104-195.

_Cost base is transferred_

the trust restructure is the same as the cost base and reduced cost
base of that asset (for the transferor) just before that acquisition.

Note: For the cost base and reduced cost base of interests in the transferee:
see Subdivision 124-A.

_Pre-CGT assets retain their status_

(3) If the transferor * acquired any of the * CGT assets * disposed of to
the transferee under the trust restructure before 20 September 1985,
the transferee is taken to have acquired it before that day.

(4) However, subsection (3) is taken never to have applied to such an
asset of the transferee if subsection 104-195(4) (CGT event J4)
applies to the transferee in relation to the asset.

_Exception: trading stock_

(5) This section does not apply to a * CGT asset if:

(a) the asset was an item of * trading stock of the transferor and
becomes an item of trading stock of the transferee; or

(b) the asset was not an item of trading stock of the transferor but
becomes an item of trading stock of the transferee when the
transferee * acquires it.

_Exception: asset must be taxable Australian property for foreign_
_resident transferee_

(6) For a transferee that is a foreign resident, this section only applies
to a * CGT asset that is * taxable Australian property just after the
transferee * acquires it under the trust restructure.

(d) apart from the roll-over, the entity would make a * capital
gain from a * CGT event happening in relation to its original
interest; and

(e) the entity chooses to obtain the roll-over; and

(f) the entity acquired the original interest on or after
20 September 1985.

Note: The entity can obtain only a partial roll-over if the capital proceeds for

interest: see section 124-990.

(2) In working out whether an original interest is exchanged for a
similar interest, disregard a difference that consists only of a right
to receive distributions of income or capital.

_Conditions for arrangement_

(3) The * arrangement must:

(a) result in the new * MDO becoming the sole * member of the

by reasonably attributing to it the cost base (or the part of it) of the
entity’s original interest for which it was exchanged and for which
the entity obtained the roll-over.

##### Section 124-1050

Note: See section 124-20 if an exchanging member uses an interest sale
facility.

(e) under the scheme, the interposed trust becomes the owner of:

(i) for a new trust case—all of the ownership interests in
the stapled entities; or

(ii) for an existing trust case—all of the ownership interests
in the other stapled entities; and

(f) the conditions in section 124-1050 are satisfied.

Note: Division 6C of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ deals
with taxing public trading trusts in the same way as companies.

(2) An entity is a **_stapled entity_** in relation to stapled securities if
* ownership interests in the entity form part of the stapled securities.

(3) Ignore for the purposes of subsection (1) * ownership interests held
by one * stapled entity in another stapled entity as at the start of the
day on which the Bill for this Act was introduced into the
Parliament.

##### 124-1050  Conditions

(1) Just after the * scheme is completed (the **_completion time_** ), each
exchanging member must own a percentage of the * ownership
interests in the interposed trust that reasonably equates to the
percentage of the ownership interests that the member owned in the
* stapled entities.

Example: Public Company A, Unit Trust No. 1 and Unit Trust No. 2 are stapled
entities. Each stapled entity has 4,000 ownership interests on issue.
There are no ownership interests in any of the stapled entities other
than shares in the company and units in the trusts.

Under a scheme for reorganising the stapled entities, Unit Trust No. 3
is interposed between the stapled entities and the owners of the
interests in those entities. Unit Trust No. 3 (the interposed trust)
becomes the owner of all of the interests in each of the three stapled
entities. Exchanging members receive one unit in the interposed trust
for each stapled security they owned. All units in the interposed trust
are of the same class.

Naomi owned 200 shares in Public Company A, 200 units in Unit
Trust No. 1 and 200 units in Unit Trust No. 2. Naomi therefore owned

##### Section 124-1055

5% of the ownership interests in each of the stapled entities. Under the
scheme, Naomi receives 100 units in Unit Trust No. 3 (out of a total of
2,000 units) in exchange for her ownership interests in the stapled
entities. Naomi now owns 5% of the ownership interests in the
interposed trust and meets the condition in subsection (1).

(2) Just after the completion time, each exchanging member must have
the same, or as nearly as practicable the same, proportionate
* market value of * ownership interests in the interposed trust as the
member had in the * stapled entities just before that time.

(3) In working out whether an exchanging member complies with
subsection (2), an anticipated reasonable approximation of the
* market value of * ownership interests just after the completion time
is sufficient.

Note: An anticipated reasonable approximation of market values of
ownership interests may include valuations provided to exchanging
members in scheme documents.

(4) You must be an Australian resident at the completion time or, if
you are a foreign resident at that time:

(a) some or all of your * ownership interests in the * stapled
entities must have been * taxable Australian property just
before that time; and

(b) your ownership interests in the interposed trust must be
taxable Australian property just after that time.

##### 124-1055  Consequences of the roll-over for exchanging members

(1) A * capital gain or * capital loss you make as a result of the * scheme
from each of your * ownership interests is disregarded.

(2) If you * acquired all of your * ownership interests in the * stapled
entities on or after 20 September 1985, the first element of the
* cost base and * reduced cost base of each of your ownership
interests in the interposed trust is such amount as is reasonable
having regard to:

(a) the total of the * cost bases of all of your ownership interests
in the * stapled entities; and

**Division 124** Replacement-asset roll-overs

##### Section 124-1055

(b) the number, * market value and character of your ownership
interests in the interposed trust.

Example: Naomi had a cost base of $2.00 for each of her 200 Public Company
A shares, $1.50 for each of her 200 Unit Trust No. 1 units and $0.50
for each of her 200 Unit Trust No. 2 units. The total of the cost bases
of all of her membership interests is $800.00.

It is reasonable to allocate $8.00 to each of the 100 units in the
interposed trust that she receives under the reorganisation.

(3) If you * acquired all of your * ownership interests in the * stapled
entities before 20 September 1985, you are taken to have acquired
all of your ownership interests in the interposed trust before that
day.

(4) If you * acquired some of your * ownership interests in the * stapled
entities before 20 September 1985, you are taken to have acquired
so many of your ownership interests in the interposed trust as is
reasonable before that day having regard to:

(a) the number, * market value and character of your ownership
interests in the stapled entities; and

(b) the number, market value and character of your ownership
interests in the interposed trust.

Note: Generally, a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT asset acquired
before 20 September 1985 can be disregarded: see Division 104.

(5) The first element of the * cost base and * reduced cost base of each
of your * ownership interests in the interposed trust that is not taken
by subsection (4) to have been * acquired before 20 September
1985 (your **_post-CGT interests_** ) is such amount as is reasonable
having regard to:

(a) the total of the cost bases of your ownership interests in the
* stapled entities that you acquired on or after 20 September
1985; and

(b) the number, * market value and character of your post-CGT
interests.

Replacement-asset roll-overs **Division 124**

##### Section 124-1060

##### 124-1060  Consequences of the roll-over for interposed trust

(1) Apply this section separately for the interposed trust in relation to
the * ownership interests in each * stapled entity that the trustee of
the interposed trust * acquires under the * scheme.

(2) A whole number of * ownership interests in a * stapled entity that
the trustee * acquires under the * scheme are taken to have been
acquired before 20 September 1985 if any of the stapled entity’s
assets as at the completion time were acquired by it before that
day.

Note: Generally, a capital gain or capital loss from a CGT asset acquired
before 20 September 1985 can be disregarded: see Division 104.

(3) The number (worked out as at the completion time) is the greatest
possible that (when expressed as a percentage of all the * ownership
interests in the * stapled entity * acquired by the trustee) does not
exceed:

(a) the * market value of the stapled entity’s assets that it
acquired before 20 September 1985; less

(b) its liabilities (if any) in respect of those assets;

expressed as a percentage of the market value of all the stapled
entity’s assets less all of its liabilities. The amounts in
paragraphs (a) and (b) are to be worked out as at the completion
time.

(4) The first element of the * cost base and * reduced cost base of each
of the trustee’s * ownership interests in that * stapled entity that are
not taken by subsection (3) to have been * acquired before
20 September 1985 is such proportion as is reasonable of the total
of the cost bases (as at the completion time) of that stapled entity’s
assets that it acquired on or after that day less its liabilities (if any)
in respect of those assets.

(5) In applying this section:

(a) a liability of a * stapled entity that is not a liability in respect
of a specific asset or assets of the stapled entity is a liability
in respect of all the assets of the stapled entity; and

proceeds.

Note: If the roll-over is under subsection 124-1105(2), some or all of the

the original entitlement as is reasonably attributable to the
ineligible part.

(3) The * reduced cost base of the ineligible part is worked out
similarly.

(4) In working out what is reasonably attributable to the ineligible part
for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3), have regard to the

##### Section 125-70

(h) the requirements of subsection (2) are met.

Example: To continue the example from subsection 125-55(1), Peter owns 400
post-CGT shares in Company A. Companies A and B are both
members of a demerger group. Company A is the head entity of the
demerger group and Company B is a demerger subsidiary.

Company A proceeds to demerge 100% of its shares in Company B to
its shareholders.

Company A enters into a proportionate capital reduction, returning 40
cents per share to its ordinary shareholders. Peter is entitled to $160
(40c times 400 shares) under the capital reduction.

For Peter, the capital reduction amount of $160 is compulsorily
applied to acquire Company A’s shares in Company B, at $6.75 (a
discount of 10% to current market value). Company A rounds up the
fractional amounts in calculating the number of whole shares to be
distributed to each shareholder. This gives Peter 24 shares in
Company B (160 divided by 6.75, rounded up to the nearest whole
number).

Note: Acquiring new interests by an owner of original interests may include
the allocation of the owner’s entitlement to new interests to a
nominee:
- to sell on the owner’s behalf; or

- to hold pending the owner being located.

(2) Each owner (an **_original owner_** ) of original interests in the * head
entity of the * demerger group must:

(a)  * acquire, under the * demerger, the same proportion, or as
nearly as practicable the same proportion, of new interests in
the * demerged entity as the original owner owned in the head
entity just before the demerger; and

(b) just after the demerger, have the same proportionate total
* market value of * ownership interests in the head entity and
demerged entity as the original owner owned in the head
entity just before the demerger.

Note 1: There is an exception: see section 125-75.

Note 2: Dual listed company voting shares are not treated as ownership
interests: see section 125-60.

Note 3: Fractional interests will generally not affect your ability to choose a
roll-over.

##### Section 125-70

Example: To continue the example from subsection (1), Company A concludes,
given the circumstances of the demerger, that the market values of
Peter’s and the other shareholders’ shares in A and B are expected to
be in proportion with their original interests in Company A, and
advises the shareholders of this position.

(3) In working out whether an original owner complies with
subsection (2):

(a) disregard * ownership interests that are original interests the
owner owns in the * demerged entity; and

(b) an anticipated reasonable approximation of the * market value
of ownership interests is sufficient.

Example: An anticipated reasonable approximation of market values of
ownership interests may include:
- valuations provided to shareholders in scheme documents;

- the price selected for use under a sale facility;

and may be made by reference to long-term value.

_Exception: off-market buy-backs_

(4) A buy-back of * shares that is an off-market purchase for the
purposes of Division 16K of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment_
_Act 1936_ is not a * demerger.

_Exception: roll-over available under another provision_

(5) Circumstances where an owner of original interests can obtain a
roll-over under a provision of this Act outside this Division for all
of the CGT events that happened to the owner’s original interests
under the circumstances cannot be a **_demerger_** .

Note: An owner might be able to obtain a roll-over for the CGT events
under Subdivision 124-E, or 124-M or Division 615.

_Meaning of_ **_demerged entity_**

(6) An entity that is a former member of a * demerger group is a
**_demerged entity_** if, under a * demerger that happens to the group,
* ownership interests in the entity are acquired by:

(a) shareholders in the * head entity of the group; or

(b) unitholders or holders of interests in the head entity of the
group.

_Meaning of_ **_demerging entity_**

(7) An entity that is a member of a * demerger group just before the
* CGT event referred to in section 125-155 happens is a **_demerging_**
**_entity_** if, under a * demerger that happens to the group:

(a) the entity (either alone or together with other members of the
demerger group) * dispose of at least 80% of their total
* ownership interests in another member of the demerger
group to owners of original interests in the * head entity of the
demerger group; or

(b) at least 80% of the total ownership interests of that entity and
of other members of the demerger group in another member
of the demerger group end and new interests are issued to
owners of original interests in the head entity; or

Note: CGT event C2 and CGT event C3 are the only relevant CGT
events.

(c) the demerged entity issues sufficient new ownership interests
in itself with the result that owners of original interests in the
head entity own at least 80% of the total ownership interests
in the demerged entity; or

(d) some combination of the processes referred to in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) happens with the effect that
members of the demerger group stop owning at least 80% of
the total ownership interests owned by members of the
demerger group in another member of the group.

##### 125-75  Exceptions to subsection 125-70(2)

_Employee share schemes_

(1) In working out whether the requirements in subsection 125-70(2)
are met, disregard each of the * ownership interests described in
subsections (2) and (3) if, just before the * demerger, those interests
(taking into account either or both of their number and value)

(a) the entity acquired a beneficial interest in the ownership
interest under an * employee share scheme; and

disregarded under subsection (1) if:

(a) both of the following would apply if Division 83A (about
employee share schemes) applied to ownership interests in
trusts in the same way as it applies to * shares:

(i) the entity acquired a beneficial interest in the ownership
interest under an * employee share scheme;

(ii) the provisions referred to in subparagraph (2)(b)(i), (ii)
or (iii) apply to the beneficial interest; and

(b) the ownership interest is not a fully-paid unit.

_Adjusting instruments_

(4) In working out whether the requirements in subsection 125-70(2)
are met, disregard each of the * ownership interests described in
subsection (5) ( **_adjusting instruments_** ) if, just before the
* demerger, those interests represented not more than 10%, or such
greater percentage (not exceeding 17%) as is prescribed, of the
ownership interests in the entity.

##### Section 125-75

(5) An * ownership interest in a * listed public company or a * listed
widely held trust that is the * head entity of a * demerger group is
disregarded under subsection (4) if:

(a) the adjusting instrument was issued on terms that ensure that
its value is not adversely affected by an * arrangement
undertaken by the company or trust in relation to other
ownership interests in the company or trust; and

(b) if the adjusting instrument can be converted into an ordinary
* share in the company or an ordinary unit in the trust, any
conversion will occur on a basis:

(i) that is set out in the terms of the issue of the instrument;
and

(ii) that is adjusted to take into account a capital reduction
or a capital reconstruction; and

(c) before conversion, the owner of the adjusting instrument
does not have a right to participate in distributions of profit
or capital except as set out in the terms of the issue of the
instrument; and

(d) the adjusting instrument deals with the effect of a * demerger
that happens to the demerger group on the value of the
instrument.

Example: Some examples of adjusting instruments are:
- convertible preference shares, including reset preference shares;

- convertible notes;

- partly paid shares where the paid-up amount is adjusted to reflect
a capital reduction.

_Additional exceptions_

(6) The regulations may provide that, in working out whether the
requirements in subsection 125-70(2) are met, other * ownership
interests of a kind specified in the regulations are to be disregarded
if, just before the * demerger, those interests represented not more
than a prescribed percentage of the ownership interests in the
entity.

##### Section 125-80

(7) However, the total percentage of * ownership interests to be
disregarded under this section must not exceed 20% of the
ownership interests in the entity.

##### 125-80  What is the roll-over?

(1) If you choose the roll-over, a * capital gain or * capital loss you
make from a * CGT event happening under the * demerger to an
original interest you own is disregarded.

(2) If you choose the roll-over, the first element of the * cost base and
* reduced cost base of:

(a) each new interest that you are not taken to have * acquired
before 20 September 1985; and

(b) if not all of your original interests ended under the
* demerger—each of your remaining original interests that
you acquired on or after 20 September 1985;

is such proportion of the sum of the cost bases of all your original
interests that you acquired on or after 20 September 1985 (worked
out just before the demerger) as is reasonable having regard to the
matters specified in subsection (3).

Note 1: These rules replace the cost base and reduced cost base adjustments in
CGT event E4 and CGT event G1.

Note 2: The head entity or the demerging entity may advise you of the
proportions.

(3) The matters are:

(a) the * market values of your remaining original interests just
after the * demerger, or an anticipated reasonable
approximation of those market values; and

(b) the market values of your new interests just after the
demerger, or an anticipated reasonable approximation of
those market values.

Example: To continue the example from subsection 125-70(2), Company A
advises its shareholders that Company B at that time represents 5% of
the market value of the group as a whole. Peter’s cost base for each of
his shares in A is $4.60, and Peter recalculates his cost base as
follows:

(6) If you * acquired some of your original interests before
20 September 1985, you are taken to have acquired a reasonable

##### Section 125-85

Note: CGT event K6 may be relevant if you later dispose of your interests
that are treated as being pre-CGT.

Example: Bert owned 100 shares in a company of which 50 were acquired
pre-CGT. Under a demerger 20 of Bert’s 100 shares were cancelled in
exchange for new interests. As 20% of his shares were cancelled, 10
of his pre-CGT shares are taken to have been cancelled.

_Partial roll-over_

(8) If you choose a roll-over for some but not all of your original
interests, you apply the rules in this section as if your original
interests for which you chose the roll-over were your only original
interests.

##### 125-85  Cost base adjustments where CGT event happens but no
##### roll-over chosen

(1) You must adjust the * cost base and * reduced cost base of an
* ownership interest you own in a company or trust if:

(a) a * demerger happens to a * demerger group of which the
company or trust is a member; and

(b) you owned an original interest in the * head entity of the
demerger group just before the demerger; and

(c) a * CGT event happens to the original interest and you
* acquire a new interest under the demerger; and

(d) you do not choose a roll-over under this Subdivision for the
original interest.

(2) The adjustments you must make are the same as the adjustments
you would have to make under section 125-80 for the * cost bases
and * reduced cost bases of the remaining original interests and new
interests just after the * CGT event if you could have chosen a
roll-over under this Subdivision for the * demerger and you had
done so.

##### Section 125-90

##### 125-90  Cost base adjustments where no CGT event

(1) You must adjust the * cost base and * reduced cost base of an
* ownership interest you own in a company or trust if:

(a) a * demerger happens to a * demerger group of which the
company or trust is a member; and

(b) you owned an original interest in the * head entity of the
demerger group just before the demerger; and

(c) no * CGT event happens to the original interest, but you
* acquire a new interest under the demerger.

(2) The adjustments you must make are the same as the adjustments
you would have to make under section 125-80 if you could have
chosen a roll-over under this Subdivision for the * demerger and
you had done so.

##### 125-95  No other cost base adjustment after demerger

If you have to make adjustments to the * cost base and * reduced
cost base of your * ownership interests under section 125-80,
125-85 or 125-90 because of a * demerger, no other adjustment can
be made under this Act to those cost bases and reduced cost bases
because of something that happens under the demerger.

Note: Those sections deal with any value shift that might occur under the
demerger and avoid the need for the general value shifting regime to
apply.

##### 125-100  No further demerger relief in some cases

This Division does not apply to the remaining * ownership interests
in a * demerged entity if one or more members of the * demerger
group * disposed of or cancelled less than 100% of the total
ownership interests of that group in the demerged entity.

Note: After the demerger, a former member of the demerger group can
undertake a further demerger to which this Division can apply.

##### 125-160  No CGT event J1

* CGT event J1 does not happen to a * demerged entity or a member
of a * demerger group under a * demerger.

##### 125-165  Adjusted capital loss for value shift under a demerger

A * capital loss made by an entity that was a member of a
* demerger group from a * CGT event happening to a * CGT asset
under a * demerger or after a demerger is reduced to the extent that
the capital loss is reasonably attributable to a reduction in the
* market value of the asset because of the demerger.

Example: The market value of equity or loan interests in the demerging entity
may be reduced by the disposal, for inadequate value, of ownership
interests of another member of the demerger group to owners of
original interests in the head entity of the group.

##### 125-170  Reduced cost base reduction if demerger asset subject to
##### roll-over

(1) The * reduced cost base of a * CGT asset is reduced if:

(a) the * market value of the asset is reduced because of a
* demerger; and

(b) after the demerger the asset is * acquired by an entity from
another entity (the **_transferor_** ) in a situation where the
transferor obtained a roll-over for the disposal; and

(c) the reduction occurred when the transferor owned the asset.

(2) The * reduced cost base of the asset as determined under the
roll-over is reduced just after the roll-over to the extent of the
reduction in * market value caused by the * demerger.

Note: The rules in section 125-165 and this section deal with any value shift
that might occur under the demerger and avoid the need for the
general value shifting regime to apply.

(3) If the * reduced cost base of a * CGT asset is reduced under this

_Share and interest sale facilities_

(1) An entity (the **_investor_** ) is treated as owning an * ownership interest
(the **_roll-over interest_** ) in a * demerged entity at a time (the **_deeming_**
**_time_** ), if:

(a) the investor owned an ownership interest in a company or

(b) a * demerger happens to the demerger group; and

(c) because:

(i) a * foreign law impedes the ability of a member of the
demerger group to issue or transfer the roll-over interest
to the investor; or

(ii) it would be impractical or unreasonably onerous to
determine whether a foreign law impedes the ability of a
member of the demerger group to issue or transfer the
roll-over interest to the investor;

it is * arranged that the member will issue or transfer the
roll-over interest to another entity (the **_facility_** ) under the
demerger instead of to the investor; and

(d) in accordance with that arrangement and as a result of the
demerger, the facility:

(i) becomes the owner of the roll-over interest (which is a
new or replacement interest in the demerged entity); and

(ii) owns the roll-over interest at the deeming time; and

(e) under the arrangement, the investor is entitled to receive from
the facility:

(i) an amount equivalent to the * capital proceeds of any
* CGT event that happens in relation to the roll-over
interest (less expenses); or

(ii) if a CGT event happens in relation to the roll-over
interest together with CGT events happening in relation
to other ownership interests—an amount equivalent to
the investor’s proportion of the total capital proceeds of
the CGT events (less expenses).

(1) There is a roll-over if a * CGT event (the **_trigger event_** ) happens
involving an individual (the **_transferor_** ) and his or her * spouse (the
**_transferee_** ), or a former * spouse (also the **_transferee_** ), because of:

(a) a court order under the _Family Law Act 1975_ or under a
* State law, * Territory law or * foreign law relating to
breakdowns of relationships between spouses; or

(b) a maintenance agreement approved by a court under
section 87 of the _Family Law Act 1975_ or a corresponding
agreement approved by a court under a corresponding
* foreign law; or

(d) something done under:

(i) a financial agreement made under Part VIIIA of the
_Family Law Act 1975_ that is binding because of
section 90G of that Act; or

(ii) a corresponding written agreement that is binding
because of a corresponding foreign law; or

that is inconsistent with the terms of the agreement in
relation to those matters, unless the agreement is varied
or set aside.

(2) Only these * CGT events are relevant:

(a) CGT events A1 and B1 (a **_disposal case_** ); and

(b) CGT events D1, D2, D3 and F1 (a **_creation case_** ).

Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 104-5.

(3) However, there is no roll-over if:

(a) the * CGT asset involved is * trading stock of the transferor; or

(b) for * CGT event B1—title in the CGT asset does not pass to
the transferee at or before the end of the agreement.

(3A) There is no roll-over because of paragraph (1)(d), (da) or (f) unless
the conditions set out in section 126-25 are met.

(4) A * capital gain or a * capital loss the transferor makes from the
* CGT event is disregarded.

_Consequences for the transferee (disposal case)_

(5) For a disposal case where the transferor * acquired the asset on or
after 20 September 1985:

(a) the _first_ element of the asset’s * cost base (in the hands of the
transferee) is the asset’s cost base (in the hands of the
transferor) at the time the transferee acquired it; and

(b) the _first_ element of the asset’s * reduced cost base (in the
hands of the transferee) is worked out similarly.

Example: Your spouse transfers land to you because of a court order under the
_Family Law Act 1975_ . Any capital gain or loss your spouse makes is
disregarded.

If the land’s cost base at the time you acquired it is $10,000, the first
element of the land’s cost base in your hands becomes $10,000.

Note 1: There are special indexation rules for roll-overs: see Division 114.

Note 2: A roll-over under this Subdivision may have an effect on the
transferee’s main residence exemption: see sections 118-178 and
118-180.

##### Section 126-15

(6) For a disposal case where the transferor * acquired the asset before
20 September 1985, the transferee is taken to have acquired it

20 September 1985 is generally disregarded: see Division 104. This
exemption is removed in some situations: see Division 149.

(7) For a disposal case where the transferor * disposed of a * collectable
or * personal use asset, the transferee is taken to have * acquired one.

relation to those matters, unless the agreement is varied
or set aside.

(2) There are other consequences if:

(a) just before the time of the trigger event, an entity (including
the transferee) owned another * CGT asset of a kind covered
by this table; and

(b) the entity * acquired it on or after 20 September 1985; and

(c) a * CGT event happens in relation to it.

**Relevant CGT assets**

**Item** **For this transferor:** **The entity can own these assets:**

1 Company (a) a * share in the company; or
(b) a loan to the company; or
(c) an indirect interest (through one or more
interposed companies or trusts) in a * share
in, or loan to, the company

2 Trustee (a) an interest or unit in the trust; or
(b) a loan to the trustee; or
(c) an indirect interest (through one or more
interposed companies or trusts) in an interest
or unit in the trust or in a loan to the trustee

Example: An individual owns all the shares in a company. The company owns
land. The individual’s marriage breaks down. A court orders that the
company transfer the land it owns to the individual’s spouse. The
individual later sells the shares.

(3) The * cost base and * reduced cost base of the other asset are
reduced by an amount that reasonably reflects the fall in its * market
value because of the trigger event. The reduction occurs at the time
of the trigger event.

(4) If the entity owning the other asset is also the transferee, the * cost
base and * reduced cost base of the other asset are then increased by
any amount that is included in the entity’s assessable income for
any income year because of the trigger event.

and

(b) the transferor was:

(i) a * CFC; or

(ii) a trustee of a trust that is a non-resident trust estate
within the meaning of section 102AAB of the _Income_
_Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the income year of the
trigger event; and

under Division 7 of Part X of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ ; or

(ii) the calculation of the attributable income of the trust
under Subdivision D of Division 6AAA of Part III of
that Act;

because (ignoring the residency assumptions in that Division
or Subdivision) the roll-over asset was not * taxable
Australian property; and

(d) a subsequent * CGT event happens in relation to the roll-over
asset.

(2) In working out the amount of any * capital gain or * capital loss the

subsequent * CGT event happens in relation to the asset, the
modifications specified in Division 7 of Part X, or Subdivision D

because (ignoring the residency assumptions in that Division)
the roll-over asset was not * taxable Australian property for
the originating company; and

(d) a subsequent * CGT event happens in relation to the roll-over

reduction is worked out under subsection (3).

(2) These conditions must be satisfied:

(a) there must be a roll-over under this Subdivision for at least
one * CGT asset that the subsidiary * acquired on or after
20 September 1985 (the **_CGT roll-over asset_** ) being
* disposed of by the subsidiary to the holding company in the

(i) be part of the liquidator’s final distribution in the course
of the liquidation; or

(ii) have occurred within 18 months of the dissolution of the
subsidiary if they are part of an interim distribution in
the course of the liquidation;

(d) the holding company must have beneficially owned all of the
shares in the subsidiary for the whole period from the time of

Capital gains and losses: special topics **Part 3-3**

Same-asset roll-overs **Division 126**

##### Section 126-85

(e) the * market value of the CGT roll-over asset or assets must
comprise at least part of the * capital proceeds for the
cancellation of the shares in the subsidiary that are
beneficially owned by the holding company;

(f) one or more of the shares that were cancelled (the **_post-CGT_**
**_shares_** ) must have been acquired by the holding company on
or after 20 September 1985.

(3) The reduction of the * capital gain is worked out in this way.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out (disregarding this section) the sum of the
* capital gains and the sum of the * capital losses the
holding company would make on the cancellation of its
shares in the subsidiary.

Step 2. Work out (disregarding this Subdivision):

(a) the sum of the * capital gains the subsidiary would
make on the * disposal of its CGT roll-over assets
to the holding company; and

(b) the sum of the * capital losses it would make except
for Subdivision 170-D on the disposal of its * CGT
assets to the holding company;

in the course of the liquidation assuming the * capital
proceeds were the assets’ * market values at the time of
the disposal.

Step 3. If, after subtracting the sum of the * capital losses from
the sum of the * capital gains, there is an overall capital
gain from step 1 and an overall capital gain from step 2,
then continue. Otherwise there is no adjustment.

Step 4. Express the number of post-CGT shares as a fraction of
the total number of shares the holding company owned in
the subsidiary.

Step 5. Multiply the overall * capital gain from Step 2 by the
fraction from Step 4.

Step 6. Reduce the overall * capital gain from Step 1 by the
amount from Step 5. The result is the * capital gain the
holding company makes from the cancellation of its

receives something in addition to the replacement share); and

(d) a * CGT event happens in relation to the replacement share
because the entity becomes absolutely entitled to the share as
against the trustee.

Note: This Subdivision does not apply to the demutualisation of a private
health insurer: see section 315-160.

##### 126-195  Consequences of roll-over

(1) A * capital gain or * capital loss the trustee makes from the * CGT
event is disregarded.

(2) The first element of the * cost base of the replacement share for the
entity is the cost base of the replacement share in the hands of the
trustee just before the * CGT event happened. The first element of
the * reduced cost base of the replacement share for the entity is
worked out similarly.

Example: The JB mutual insurance company demutualises, issuing shares in JB
Limited to its policyholders. It is unable to locate some of its
policyholders so it establishes a trust and issues shares to the trustee
on behalf of those policyholders. Steve is one of those policyholders
(being potentially entitled to 50 shares).

JB Limited is taken over by PVDM Limited. Members of JB are
issued with 2 shares in PVDM for each share they have in JB. The
trustee obtains a roll-over under Subdivision 124-M for the exchange.
Each PVDM share held by the trustee has a cost base and reduced cost
base of $15.

Steve writes to the trustee and proves his entitlement to the shares held
in trust for him.

There is a roll-over under this Subdivision so that any capital gain or
loss made by the trustee is disregarded. The first element of the cost
base and reduced cost base of each of Steve’s PVDM shares is $15.

Same-asset roll-overs **Division 126**

##### Section 126-235

benefit from the trust is not capable of being significantly affected
by the exercise, or non-exercise, of a power.

(4) However, if both trusts are * managed investment trusts, disregard a
power if the power’s existence at that time does not significantly
affect the * market value at that time of each * membership interest
in each of the trusts.

##### 126-235  Exceptions for roll-over

_Foreign trusts_

(1) An exception applies for a * CGT asset if:

(a) the receiving trust is a * foreign trust for CGT purposes for the
income year that includes the transfer time; and

(b) the roll-over asset is not * taxable Australian property just
after the transfer time.

_Public trading trusts_

(2) Another exception applies if either trust is a trust to which
section 102S of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies for
the income year that includes the transfer time.

_Choices_

(3) Another exception applies if, just after the transfer time:

(a) a choice (however described) under a provision of a * taxation
law is in force for either of the trusts in relation to particular
circumstances; and

(b) the same choice (however described) under that provision for
the other trust in relation to those circumstances (a **_mirror_**
**_choice_** ) is not also in force; and

(c) the absence of a mirror choice would or could have an
ongoing effect on the calculation of an entity’s * net income,

##### Section 126-240

(ii) a later income year.

(4) However, the exception in subsection (3) does not apply if:

(a) the other trust makes a mirror choice before the first time
after the transfer time when the absence of the mirror choice
would affect the calculation of an entity’s * net income, or
taxable income, for an income year; or

(b) it would not be reasonable for subsection (3) to apply.

Note: For paragraph (a), the other trust must still be able, under the relevant
provision of the taxation law, to make the mirror choice.

(5) If, just after the transfer time:

(a) a choice (however described) referred to in paragraph (3)(a)
is in force for either of the trusts (the **_first choice_** ); and

(b) a provision of a * taxation law:

(i) prevents the revocation or variation of that choice; or

(ii) sets out a consequence for an entity if that choice is
revoked or varied;

that provision is taken to apply for a mirror choice, in force for the
other trust at or after that time, in a way corresponding to the way
in which it applies for the first choice.

Note: For example, if the provision sets out consequences that flow from the
revocation of the first choice, then those consequences will also flow
if the mirror choice is revoked.

##### 126-240  Consequences for the trusts

_Disregard any capital gain or loss_

(1) If the roll-over is chosen, disregard any * capital gain or * capital
loss the trustee of the transferring trust makes from:

(a) creating the receiving trust over the roll-over asset; or

(b) transferring the roll-over asset to the receiving trust;

at the transfer time.

Capital gains and losses: special topics **Part 3-3**

Same-asset roll-overs **Division 126**

##### Section 126-240

_Adjust roll-over asset’s cost base and reduced cost base_

(2) If the roll-over is chosen:

(a) the first element of the roll-over asset’s * cost base, in the
hands of the receiving trust, is its cost base just before the
transfer time; and

(b) the first element of the roll-over asset’s * reduced cost base is
worked out similarly.

_Any pre-transfer losses of receiving trust cannot be utilised_

(3) If the roll-over is chosen:

(a) any * net capital loss of the receiving trust for an income year
ending before the transfer time cannot be applied after the
transfer time to reduce an amount of that trust’s * capital
gains; and

(b) the sum of the receiving trust’s * capital losses for the income
year that includes the transfer time (the **_transfer year_** ) is
reduced by an amount equal to any net capital loss that the
trust would have had for that year had that year ended just
before the transfer time; and

(c) any * tax loss of the receiving trust for an income year ending
before the transfer time cannot be deducted after the transfer
time from an amount of that trust’s assessable income or * net
exempt income; and

(d) the sum of the receiving trust’s deductions for the transfer
year is reduced by an amount equal to any tax loss that the
trust would have had for that year had that year ended just
before the transfer time.

References in this subsection to the transfer time are to be read as
references to the start time if subsection 126-225(2) applies.

Note: Subsection 126-225(2) applies if the roll-over asset is transferred to
the receiving trust after an earlier roll-over under this Subdivision, for
another asset, was obtained for the trusts.

_Pre-CGT assets_

(4) If:

(a) the roll-over is chosen; and

(b) the transferring trust last * acquired the roll-over asset before
20 September 1985;

the receiving trust is taken to have acquired it before that day.

##### 126-245  Consequences for beneficiaries—general approach for
##### working out cost base etc.

(1) If the roll-over is chosen, each of the following:

(a) the * cost base and * reduced cost base of each of a
beneficiary’s * membership interests in each trust;

(b) the time each of the beneficiary’s membership interests in the
receiving trust is treated as having been * acquired;

is adjusted under this section for the transfer time unless the
beneficiary has chosen for them to be adjusted under
section 126-250.

Note: The beneficiary can choose for these things to be adjusted once for
several consecutive transfer times (for multiple roll-over assets) if the
beneficiary owned the interests at all of those times (see
section 126-250).

_First element of cost base of interests in transferring trust_

(2) The first element of the * cost base, just after the transfer time, of
each of the beneficiary’s * membership interests in the transferring
trust is an amount equal to such proportion of the interest’s cost
base just before the transfer time as is reasonable having regard to:

(a) the * market value of the interest just after the transfer time, or
a reasonable approximation of that market value; and

(b) the market value of the interest just before the transfer time,
or a reasonable approximation of that market value.

_First element of cost base of interests in receiving trust_

(3) The first element of the * cost base, just after the transfer time, of

just before the transfer time, of each of those corresponding
membership interests in the transferring trust; and

(c) if, just after the transfer time, that interest in the receiving
trust corresponds to a proportion of one of the beneficiary’s
membership interests in the transferring trust—that

trust;

reasonably approximates:

(d) if paragraph (b) applies—the sum of the cost bases, just after

##### Section 126-250

_Time of acquisition for interests in the receiving trust_

(5) Each of the beneficiary’s * membership interests in the receiving
trust is treated as having been * acquired just after the transfer time.

_Time of acquisition for pre-CGT interests in the receiving trust_

(6) However, if one or more of the beneficiary’s * membership interests

##### 126-250  Consequences for beneficiaries—other approach for
##### working out cost base etc.

(1) This section applies if the beneficiary owns one or more

time); or

(ii) a later time in the transfer year that is the transfer time
for another asset for which a roll-over is obtained under

* membership interests and of the beneficiary’s corresponding
membership interests in the receiving trust;

(b) the time each of those corresponding interests in the
receiving trust is treated as having been * acquired;

to be adjusted under subsection (3) for the period.

were references to just before the starting time; and

(b) references in those subsections to just after the transfer time

(a) the creation of the receiving trust over the roll-over asset; or

(b) the transfer of the roll-over asset to the receiving trust;

no other adjustment is to be made under this Act to those cost
bases and reduced cost bases because of something that happens in
relation to that event.

Note: This section prevents the general value shifting regime from applying
in relation to the event because sections 126-245 and 126-250 deal
with any value shift that might occur.

##### 126-260  Giving information to beneficiaries

_Beneficiaries must be given particulars of the roll-over_

(1) If the roll-over is chosen, the trustee of the transferring trust must,

##### Section 126-265

_If the transferring trust has multiple trustees_

(5) If the transferring trust has 2 or more trustees, the obligation
imposed by subsection (1) is imposed on each of the trustees, but
may be discharged by any of the trustees.

Note: Each of the trustees commits an offence against subsection (3) if none
of them discharges the obligation imposed by subsection (1).

(6) In a prosecution of a trustee for an offence against subsection (3)
for an act or omission contravening subsection (1), it is a defence if
the trustee proves that the trustee:

(a) did not aid, abet, counsel or procure the act or omission; and

(b) was not in any way knowingly concerned in, or party to, the
act or omission (whether directly or indirectly and whether
by any act or omission of the trustee).

(c) because:

(i) a * foreign law impedes the ability of the receiving trust
to issue or transfer the roll-over interest to the investor;
or

(ii) it would be impractical or unreasonably onerous to
determine whether a foreign law impedes the ability of
the receiving trust to issue or transfer the roll-over

**Item**

**For this kind of CGT**
**asset:**

**The first element of**
**the asset’s cost base is:**

**The first element of**
**the asset’s reduced**
**cost base is:**

the market value of the
asset on the day you
died

4 One you * acquired
before 20 September
1985

the * market value of the
asset on the day you
died

Note 1: Section 70-105 has a general rule that the person on whom the trading
stock devolves is taken to have bought it for its market value. There
are some exceptions though.

Note 2: Subdivision 118-B contains other rules about dwellings acquired
through deceased estates.

Note 3: The rule in item 3 in the table does not apply to a dwelling that
devolved to your legal personal representative, or passed to a
beneficiary in your estate, on or before 7.30 pm on 20 August 1996:
see section 128-15 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act_

_Further rule for a beneficiary_

(5) A beneficiary can include in the * cost base or * reduced cost base of
the asset any expenditure that the * legal personal representative
_would_ have been able to include at the time the asset * passes to the
beneficiary. The beneficiary can include the expenditure on the day
the representative incurred it.

Example: You die on 1 May 1995 owning land. On 15 June 1995 your legal
personal representative pays $500 council rates for the land.

On 31 July 1995 your representative transfers it to a beneficiary in
your estate, who is taken to have acquired it on 1 May 1995.

The beneficiary can include the $500 in the third element of the cost
base of the land. It is included on 15 June 1995.

_Collectables and personal use assets_

(6) The * legal personal representative or beneficiary is taken to have
* acquired a * collectable or a * personal use asset if:

(b) it was a * collectable or a * personal use asset (as appropriate)
in your hands when you died.

Note 1: Capital losses from collectables can be used only to reduce capital
gains from collectables: see section 108-10.

section 108-20.

##### 128-20  When does an asset **_pass_** **to a beneficiary?**

beneficiary becomes the owner of the asset:

(a) under your will, or that will as varied by a court order; or

(b) by operation of an intestacy law, or such a law as varied by a
court order; or

(c) because it is appropriated to the beneficiary by your legal
personal representative in satisfaction of a pecuniary legacy
or some other interest or share in your estate; or

(d) under a deed of arrangement if:

(i) the beneficiary entered into the deed to settle a claim to
participate in the distribution of your estate; and

(ii) any consideration given by the beneficiary for the asset
consisted only of the variation or waiver of a claim to
one or more other * CGT assets that formed part of your
estate.

(It does not matter whether the asset is transmitted directly to the
beneficiary or is transferred to the beneficiary by your * legal
personal representative.)

(2) A * CGT asset does _not_ **_pass_** to a beneficiary in your estate if the

dying * passes to a beneficiary in your estate who (when the asset
passes) is the trustee of a * complying superannuation entity.

Note: A capital gain or loss is also made: see section 104-215.

(2) The beneficiary is taken to have * acquired the asset on the day you
died. The first element of the * cost base and * reduced cost base of
the asset is its * market value on that day.

(3) The beneficiary can include in the * cost base or * reduced cost base
of the asset any expenditure that your * legal personal representative
_would_ have been able to include at the time the asset * passes to the
beneficiary. The beneficiary can include the expenditure on the day
the representative incurred it.

(1) This section has rules that are relevant if a * CGT asset is owned by
joint tenants and one of them dies.

(2) The survivor is taken to have * acquired (on the day the individual
died) the individual’s interest in the asset. If there are 2 or more
survivors, they are taken to have acquired that interest in equal
shares.

Note: Joint tenants are treated as owning a CGT asset in equal shares: see
section 108-7.

(3) If the individual who died * acquired his or her interest in the asset
on or after 20 September 1985, the first element of the * cost base
of the interest _each_ survivor is taken to have acquired is:

Cost base of the interest of the individual who died

(worked out on the day the individual died)

Effect of death **Division 128**

##### Section 128-50

Example: In 1999 2 individuals buy land for $50,000 as joint tenants. Each one
is taken to have a 50% interest in it. On 1 May 2001 one of them dies.

The survivor is taken to have acquired the interest of the individual
who died on 1 May 2001. If the cost base of that interest on that day is
$27,000, the survivor is taken to have acquired that interest for that
amount.

(4) If the individual who died * acquired his or her interest in the asset
before 20 September 1985, the first element of the * cost base and
* reduced cost base of the interest _each_ survivor is taken to have
acquired is:

*Market value of the interest of the individual who died

(worked out on the day the individual died)

**Part 3-3** Capital gains and losses: special topics
**Division 130** Investments

##### Section 130-40

**Modifications on exercise of rights**

**Item** **In this situation:** **The modification is...**

The first element of your * cost base
for the shares, units or options is the
sum of:

(a) the * market value of the rights
when they were exercised; and

(b) any amount paid to exercise the
rights, except to the extent that
the amount is represented in the
paragraph (a) amount; and

3 You exercise rights
issued to you to * acquire
the * shares, units or
options, and you
acquired the original
shares or * convertible
interests, or the original
units or convertible
interests, before
20 September 1985.

(c) all the amounts to be added
under subsection (6A).

The first element of their * reduced
cost base is worked out similarly.

(6A) An amount is to be added under this subsection if a * capital gain
made from the right has been reduced under section 118-20. This is
so even though a capital gain that is made on exercise is
disregarded under subsection (7). The amount to be added is the
amount of the reduction.

Note: For example, a capital gain made on the exercise of the right under
section 118-20 may be reduced because an amount is included in the
owner’s assessable income under subsection 26BB(2) of the _Income_
_Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (about assessing a gain on disposal or
redemption of a traditional security) or section 159GS of that Act
(about balancing adjustments on transfer of a qualifying security).

(7) A * capital gain or * capital loss you make from the exercise of the
rights is disregarded.

Note 1: The exercise of the rights would be an example of CGT event C2
(about a CGT asset ending).

Note 2: There are transitional rules for some rights: see section 130-40 of the
_Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ .

Note 3: The effect of this Subdivision is modified in 2 cases by
sections 102AAZBA (about non-resident trusts) and 414 (about
CFC’s) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

##### Section 130-60

**Conversion of a convertible interest**

**Item** **In this situation:** **The modification is...**

The first element of the * cost base
of the units is the sum of:
(a) the cost base of the convertible
interest at the time of
conversion; and

3 You * acquire units in a
unit trust by converting a
* convertible interest
(except one that is a
* traditional security) that
was issued by the trustee
of the unit trust after
28 January 1988.

(b) any amount paid to convert the
convertible interest, except to
the extent that the amount is
represented in the paragraph (a)
amount; and

(c) all the amounts to be added
under subsection (1A).

The first element of their * reduced
cost base is worked out similarly.

(1A) An amount is to be added under this subsection if a * capital gain
from the * convertible interest has been reduced under
section 118-20. This is so even though a capital gain that is made
on conversion is disregarded under subsection (3). The amount to
be added is the amount of the reduction.

Note: For example, a capital gain made on the conversion under
section 118-20 may be reduced because an amount is included in the

##### 130-75  Objects of Subdivision

The objects of this Subdivision are:

(a) to recognise that:

(i) Division 83A contains the primary rules for taxing gains
on * ESS interests acquired under * employee share
schemes; and

(ii)  * capital gains and * capital losses on such interests
should usually be disregarded during the period in
which Division 83A applies to them; and

(b) to align the treatment of ESS interests under Division 83A
and the CGT provisions by, for example:

(i) turning off certain special CGT rules; and

(ii) extending some of the deeming provisions of that
Division into the CGT provisions; and

(c) to disregard * employee share trusts for most CGT purposes,
by treating ESS interests owned by such trusts as being
directly owned by the beneficiaries of the trusts.

(4) Sections 112-20 and 116-30 (about the market value substitution
rule) do not apply to the extent that they relate to:

(a) you acquiring an * ESS interest to which Subdivision 83A-C
(about employee share schemes) applies; or

(b) you:

(i) forfeiting an ESS interest; or

(ii) forfeiting or losing an ESS interest that is a beneficial

Investments **Division 130**

##### Section 130-85

Note 1: An interest you hold in an employee share trust may give rise to an
ESS interest because of the operation of section 83A-320.

Note 2: As a result of subsection (2) of this section, CGT event E5 might
happen at the time of acquisition. This may result in the trustee
making a capital gain. However, any capital gain made by the
beneficiary would be disregarded under section 130-80.

(3) However, if this section applies to you because an * associate of
yours * acquired the * ESS interest, Division 83A, this Part and
Part 3-3 apply as if your associate were absolutely entitled to the
relevant * share or right (instead of you):

(a) either:

(i) if Subdivision 83A-B applies to the ESS interest—from
the time of acquisition; or

(ii) if Subdivision 83A-C applies to the ESS interest—from
immediately after the * ESS deferred taxing point for the
ESS interest; and

(b) until your associate no longer has an ESS interest in the share
or right.

Note: Once the ESS interest has been taxed to you under Subdivision 83A-B
or 83A-C, section 83A-305 (which treats the interest as having been
acquired by you, rather than your associate) is no longer relevant.
Subsection (3) of this section ensures that your associate then gets the
same tax treatment as you would have, had you originally acquired the
interest. This does not, however, imply a disposal from you to your
associate.

_Meaning of_ **_employee share trust_**

(4) An **_employee share trust_** , for an * employee share scheme, is a trust
whose sole activities are:

(a) obtaining * shares or rights in a company; and

(b) ensuring that * ESS interests in the company that are
beneficial interests in those shares or rights are provided
under the employee share scheme to employees, or to
* associates of employees, of:

(i) the company; or

(ii) a * subsidiary of the company; and

**Division 134** Options

##### Section 134-1

Note 2: Item 1 in the table is modified for certain options granted before
20 September 1985: see section 134-1 of the _Income Tax (Transitional_
_Provisions) Act 1997_ .

Note 3: Item 1 in the table is modified for ESS interests acquired under
employee share schemes: see Division 83A and section 112-97.

Note 4: This Division has no operation in relation to an option acquired under
an employee share scheme if the option is exercised before the ESS
deferred taxing point for the option: see Subdivision 130-D.
Division 83A applies instead.

(2) All the payments can include giving property: see section 103-5.

Example 1:Steven obtains an option to buy a yacht (for $75,000) from Tom.
Steven pays $5,000 for the option.

Steven exercises the option. The first element of his cost base and
reduced cost base for the yacht includes the expenditure he incurred
for the option.

So, the first element of his cost base and reduced cost base for the
yacht is:

$75,000 $5,000 $80,000  

Example 2:An entity owns 1,000 shares in a company. Bill grants the entity an
option which, if exercised, would require him to buy the shares for $2
each. The entity pays Bill 10 cents per share for the option.

The entity exercises the option. Bill paid $2,000 for the shares. He
received $100 from the entity for granting the option.

The first element of Bill’s cost base and reduced cost base for the
shares is:

$2,000 – $100 $1,900 

In working out whether the entity made a capital gain or loss on the
sale of the shares, the second element of its cost base (and reduced
cost base) includes the $100 the entity paid for the option.

(4) A * capital gain or * capital loss the grantee makes from exercising
the option is disregarded. However, this rule does not apply if the
grantee * acquired the option under a trust restructure (see
Subdivision 124-N) and, on exercising the option, held the
resulting asset as an item of * trading stock.

(5) This Division does not apply to rights or options to which
Subdivision 130-B applies.

Note: Subdivision 130-B deals (amongst other things) with rights and
options issued by a company or trust where you did not pay or give
anything to acquire them.

(6) This Division does not apply to:

(a) an option to the extent that the option binds the grantor to
* dispose of * foreign currency; or

(b) an option to the extent that the option binds the grantor to
* acquire * foreign currency.

(7) Section 960-235 (about suspected transactions involving 5% or
more of * shares in the company or units in the trust) is disregarded.

##### 149-60  What the evidence must show

(1A) To avoid the consequences in section 149-70, the following
condition must be complied with.

(1) On the basis solely of the evidence given to the Commissioner
under subsection 149-55(1), the Commissioner must be satisfied
that, or think it reasonable to assume that, at the end of the * test
day, * majority underlying interests in the asset were had by
* ultimate owners who also had * majority underlying interests in the
asset at the end of the starting day. The **_starting day_** is:

(a) a day the entity chooses under subsection (2); or

(b) if no day is so chosen—19 September 1985.

(2) The day chosen:

(a) must be no earlier than 1 July 1985 and no later than 30 June
1986; and

(b) must be one the choice of which will allow evidence to be
given that enables a reasonable approximation of the
* ultimate owners who had * underlying interests in the assets
of the entity at the end of 19 September 1985.

_How unidentified owners are treated_

(3) So far as the evidence does not show who had * underlying interests
in the asset at the end of the * starting day, the evidence must be
treated on the assumption that those interests were then had by
* ultimate owners who did _not_ have * underlying interests in the
asset at the end of the * test day.

_New owner standing in the shoes of former owner_

(4) Subsection (5) affects how the evidence must be treated if an
* ultimate owner (the **_new owner_** ) has acquired a percentage (the
**_acquired percentage_** ) of the * underlying interests in the asset

**Division 152** Small business relief

##### Section 152-1

### Division 152—Small business relief

#### Guide to Division 152

##### 152-1  What this Division is about

To help small business, if the basic conditions for relief are
satisfied, capital gains can be reduced by the various concessions
in this Division. Those basic conditions are in Subdivision 152-A.
Some of the concessions have additional, specific conditions that
must also be satisfied.

The 4 available small business concessions are:

(a) the 15-year exemption (in Subdivision 152-B);

(b) the 50% reduction (in Subdivision 152-C);

(c) the retirement concession (in Subdivision 152-D);

(d) the roll-over (in Subdivision 152-E).

A capital gain that qualifies for the 15-year exemption is
disregarded entirely and is not taken into account under the method
statement in subsection 102-5(1). By contrast, the other
concessions are only activated by step 4 of that method statement.
This means that you must apply all available capital losses against
your capital gains (under steps 1 and 2) before you can reduce
them using those 3 concessions.

152-E Small business roll-over

#### Subdivision 152-A—Basic conditions for relief under this
#### Division

#### Guide to Subdivision 152-A

##### 152-5  What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision sets out some basic conditions for relief. If the
basic conditions are satisfied, an entity may be able to reduce its
capital gains using the small business concessions in this Division.

The 2 major basic conditions are:

(a) the entity must be a CGT small business entity or a
partner in a partnership that is a CGT small business
entity, or the net value of assets that the entity and
related entities own must not exceed $6,000,000; and

(b) the CGT asset must be an active asset.

Additional basic conditions must be satisfied in the following
circumstances:

(a) the CGT asset is a share in a company or an interest in a
trust;

(b) the CGT event involves certain rights or interests in
relation to the income or capital of a partnership.

Some of the concessions have additional, specific conditions that
also must be satisfied. For example, the 15-year exemption applies
only if you have held the CGT asset for at least 15 years and you
retire.

There are limitations on the availability of the small business
concessions for CGT events J2, J5 and J6.

##### Section 152-20

Note: The net value of the CGT assets of the individual will be reduced by
the same proportion of the individual’s liabilities related to the
dwelling, ownership interest or adjacent land.

_Net value of the CGT assets of others_

(3) In working out the **_net value of the CGT assets_** of:

(a) your * affiliate; or

(b) an entity that is * connected with your affiliate;

include only those assets that are used, or held ready for use, in the
carrying on of a * business by you or another entity * connected with
you (whether the business is carried on alone or jointly with
others).

Note: The meaning of **_connected with_** is affected by section 152-78.

(4) However, disregard assets under subsection (3) that are used, or
held ready for use, in the carrying on of a * business by an entity
that is * connected with you only because of your * affiliate.

Example: You and your husband sell a florist’s business that you jointly carry
on. Your husband also wholly owns a company that carries on a
newsagency business. You yourself have no other involvement with
the newsagency business.

Under subsection (4), you disregard the newsagency company’s assets
in working out whether you satisfy the maximum net asset value test
because, although the company is “connected” with you, it is so
connected only because of your affiliate (your husband).

Note: The meaning of **_connected with_** is affected by section 152-78.

_Effect of look-through earnout rights_

(5) Despite subsections (1) to (4), in working out the **_net value of the_**
**_CGT assets_** of an entity at the time just before the * CGT event (the
**_valuing time_** ), you can make a choice under subsection (6) if:

(a) at the valuing time, one or more of the entity’s * CGT assets
were assets for which the entity later provided, or was later
provided with, one or more * financial benefits under one or
more * look-through earnout rights that were in existence at
the valuing time; or

(b) at the valuing time, one or more of the entity’s CGT assets
were look-through earnout rights relating to CGT assets of:

(i) one or more of the other entities referred to in
section 152-15; or

(ii) one or more entities not referred to in that section; or

(c) you are the entity, and:

(i) the CGT event referred to in section 152-15 happened
because you * disposed of a CGT asset; and

(ii) your * capital proceeds from the disposal were affected
by one or more financial benefits provided to, or by, you
under one or more look-through earnout rights;

and no further financial benefits can be provided under any of
those look-through earnout rights.

Note: For paragraph (c), capital proceeds can be affected by financial
benefits provided under a look-through earnout right (see
section 116-120).

(6) You can choose to treat the * market value of each of the * CGT
assets first mentioned in the applicable paragraph of subsection (5)
as if it were, at the valuing time, equal to:

(a) if paragraph (5)(a) applies—the first element of the CGT
asset’s * cost base at the valuing time; or

(b) if subparagraph (5)(b)(i) applies—nil; or

(c) if subparagraph (5)(b)(ii) applies—the total of the financial
benefits provided under the * look-through earnout right after
the valuing time; or

(d) if paragraph (5)(c) applies—those * capital proceeds.

Note: For paragraph (a), the first element of a CGT asset’s cost base can be
affected by financial benefits provided under a look-through earnout
right (see section 112-36).

(7) In working out the **_net value of the CGT assets_** of an entity at the
valuing time, if:

(a) you make a choice under subsection (6) about a * CGT asset
of the entity that is a CGT asset covered by paragraph (5)(a)
or (c); and

also a CGT asset of the entity;

treat the * market value of that right as if it were nil at the valuing
time.

#### Active asset test

##### 152-35  Active asset test

(1) A * CGT asset satisfies the active asset test if:

(a) you have owned the asset for 15 years or less and the asset
was an * active asset of yours for a total of at least half of the
period specified in subsection (2); or

(b) you have owned the asset for more than 15 years and the
asset was an active asset of yours for a total of at least 7 1 / 2 
years during the period specified in subsection (2).

(2) The period:

(a) begins when you * acquired the asset; and

(b) ends at the earlier of:

(i) the * CGT event; and

(ii) if the relevant business ceased to be carried on in the 12
months before that time or any longer period that the
Commissioner allows—the cessation of the business.

##### 152-40  Meaning of **_active asset_**

(1) A * CGT asset is an **_active asset_** at a time if, at that time:

(a) you own the asset (whether the asset is tangible or intangible)
and it is used, or held ready for use, in the course of carrying
on a * business that is carried on (whether alone or in
partnership) by:

(i) you; or

(ii) your * affiliate; or

(b) if the asset is an intangible asset—you own it and it is
inherently connected with a business that is carried on
(whether alone or in partnership) by you, your affiliate, or
another entity that is connected with you.

Note 1: An intangible asset need satisfy only paragraph (a) or paragraph (b).

Note 2: The meaning of **_connected with_** in subparagraph (1)(a)(iii) and
paragraph (b) is affected by section 152-78.

Note 3: An example of an asset that is inherently connected with a business is
goodwill or the benefit of a restrictive covenant.

Note 4: For businesses that are winding up, see section 152-49 and
subsection 328-110(5).

(2) Subsection 392-20(1) is disregarded in determining, for the
purposes of subsection (1) of this section, whether an entity is
carrying on a * business.

Note: An entity would be taken to be carrying on a primary production
business under subsection 392-20(1) if the business is carried on by a
trust and the entity is presently entitled to trust income.

(3) A * CGT asset is also an **_active asset_** at a given time if, at that time,
you own it and:

(a) it is either a * share in a company that is an Australian
resident at that time or an interest in a trust that is a * resident
trust for CGT purposes for the income year in which that
time occurs; and

(b) the total of:

(i) the * market values of the active assets of the company
or trust; and

(ii) the market value of any financial instruments of the
company or trust that are inherently connected with a
business that the company or trust carries on; and

(iii) any cash of the company or trust that is inherently
connected with such a business;

is 80% or more of the market value of all of the assets of the
company or trust.

##### Section 152-40

(3A) A * share in a company, or an interest in a trust, mentioned in
paragraph (3)(a) is an **_active asset_** at a time (the **_later time_** ) if:

(a) the share or interest was an active asset at an earlier time; and

(b) it is reasonable to conclude that the share or interest is still an
active asset at the later time.

Note: This ensures that the 80% test does not need to be applied on a day to
day basis.

(3B) A * share in a company, or an interest in a trust, mentioned in
paragraph (3)(a) is an **_active asset_** at a time if:

(a) the share or interest fails to meet the requirements under
subsection (3) at that time; and

(b) the failure is of a temporary nature only.

Note: If a share in a company or an interest in a trust is chosen as a
replacement asset, this ensures that a temporary failure of the 80% test
does not automatically lead to CGT event J2 happening.

_Exceptions_

(4) However, the following * CGT assets cannot be **_active assets_** :

(a) interests in an entity that is _*_ connected with you, other than
* shares and interests covered by subsection (3);

(b) shares in a company, other than:

(i) shares in a * widely held company that are covered by
subsection (3), (3A) or (3B) and held by a * CGT
concession stakeholder of the company; and

(ii) shares in any other company that are covered by
subsection (3), (3A) or (3B);

(c) interests in a trust, other than:

(i) interests in a trust to which subsection (5) applies that
are covered by subsection (3), (3A) or (3B) and held by
a CGT concession stakeholder of the trust; and

(ii) interests in any other trust that are covered by
subsection (3), (3A) or (3B);

(e) an asset whose main use by you is to * derive interest, an
annuity, rent, royalties or foreign exchange gains unless:

(i) the asset is an intangible asset and has been
substantially developed, altered or improved by you so
that its * market value has been substantially enhanced;
or

(ii) its main use for deriving rent was only temporary.

Example:A company uses a house purely as an investment property and
rents it out. The house is not an **_active asset_** because the company
is not using the house in the course of carrying on a business. If,
on the other hand, the company ran the house as a guest house
the house would be an **_active asset_** because the company would
be using it to carry on a business and not to derive rent.

Note: The meaning of **_connected with_** is affected by section 152-78.

(4A) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(e), in determining the main use
of an asset:

(a) disregard any personal use or enjoyment of the asset by you;
and

(b) treat any use by your * affiliate, or an entity that is * connected
with you, as your use.

Note: The meaning of **_connected with_** is affected by section 152-78.

(5) This subsection applies to a trust if:

(a) interests in the trust are listed for quotation in the official list
of an * approved stock exchange; or

(b) the trust has more than 50 * members, unless the trust is a
discretionary trust or a trust where at least one of the
following conditions is met during an income year:

(i) no more than 20 persons held, or had the right to acquire
or become the holders of, * membership interests
representing at least 75% of the value of the
membership interests in the trust;

section 152-35 applies as if:

(a) you had acquired the new asset when you acquired the old
asset; and

(b) the new asset had been your * active asset at all times when
the original asset was your active asset; and

(c) the new asset had not been your active asset at all times when
the original asset was not your active asset.

Note 1: Subdivision 124-B allows you to choose a roll-over if your CGT asset

time; and

(ii) the intermediate entity’s indirect small business
participation percentage (if any) in the test entity at that
time (as worked out under one or more other

satisfied;

- the entity continuously owned the asset for the 15-year period
leading up to the CGT event;

- if the entity is an individual, the individual retires or is
permanently incapacitated;

individual for a total of at least 15 years during which the
entity owned the asset and the individual who was the
significant individual just before the CGT event retires or is
permanently incapacitated.

##### Section 152-200

#### Subdivision 152-C—Small business 50% reduction

#### Guide to Subdivision 152-C

##### 152-200  What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision tells you how to apply the small business CGT
concessions mentioned in step 4 of the method statement in
subsection 102-5(1).

A capital gain is reduced by 50% if the basic conditions in
Subdivision 152-A are satisfied.

If the capital gain has already been reduced by the discount
percentage, the 50% reduction under this Subdivision applies to
that reduced gain.

The capital gain may be further reduced by the small business
retirement exemption or a small business rollover, or both.

Alternatively, you may choose not to apply the 50% reduction and
instead apply the small business retirement exemption or small
business rollover.

None of these rules apply if the 15-year exemption already applies
to the capital gain, since such a gain is disregarded anyway.

##### Table of sections

152-205 You get the small business 50% reduction

152-210 You may also get the small business retirement exemption and small

the method statement is 50%. Therefore, the combined effect of the
discount percentage and this section would be to reduce the original
capital gain by a total of 75%.

For an individual who opts to claim indexation, or a company, there is
no discount percentage, so the individual or company would simply
get the 50% reduction under this section.

##### 152-210  You may also get the small business retirement exemption
##### and small business roll-over relief

(1) The * capital gain, as reduced under section 152-205, may also
qualify for:

(a) the small business retirement exemption (see
Subdivision 152-D); or

(b) a small business roll-over (see Subdivision 152-E);

or both.

(2) If it qualifies for both of those concessions, you may choose which
order to apply them in.

##### 152-215  15-year rule has priority

This Subdivision does not apply to a * capital gain to which
Subdivision 152-B (15-year exemption) applies.

Note: Under that Subdivision, such a gain is entirely disregarded, so there is
no need for any further concession to apply.

##### 152-220  You may choose not to apply this Subdivision

You may choose not to apply the reduction mentioned in
section 152-205 to a particular * capital gain.

proceeds from the event are used in connection with your
retirement.

There is a lifetime limit of $500,000 for all choices that can be
made in respect of an individual under this Subdivision.

You may choose not to apply the concession in section 152-205
(small business 50% reduction) before this one. For an additional

##### 152-305  Choosing the exemption

_Individual_

(1) If you are an individual, you can choose to disregard all or part of a
* capital gain if:

(a) the basic conditions in Subdivision 152-A are satisfied for
the gain; and

(b) if you are under 55 just before you make the choice—you
contribute an amount equal to the asset’s * CGT exempt
amount to a * complying superannuation fund or an * RSA;
and

Note: For the non-deductibility of the contribution, see
subsection 290-150(4).

(c) the contribution is made:

(i) if the relevant CGT event is CGT event J2, J5 or J6—
when you made the choice; or

(ii) otherwise—at the later of when you made the choice
and when you received the proceeds.

Note 1: Section 103-25 tells you when the choice must be made.

(1A) If you receive the * capital proceeds from the * CGT event in
instalments, paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) apply to each instalment in
succession (up to the asset’s * CGT exempt amount).

(1B) For the purposes of (but without limiting) subsection (1A), you are
treated as receiving the * capital proceeds in instalments if:

(a) the * CGT event happened because you * disposed of the
* CGT asset; and

(b) the capital proceeds from the disposal are increased by one or
more * financial benefits that you receive under a
* look-through earnout right.

_Company or trust_

(2) A company or a trust (except a public entity—see subsection (3))

that a company or trust makes to comply with
section 152-325; and

(b) the paying entity passes on the payment to the * CGT
concession stakeholder or another interposed entity;

then:

(c) the payment cannot be deducted from the paying entity’s
assessable income; and

(d) the payment received by the paying entity is not assessable
income and is not * exempt income.

##### 152-315  Choosing the amount to disregard

(1) You can choose to disregard all or part of each * capital gain to
which this Subdivision applies.

Note 1: You make capital gains equal to any parts that you do not choose to
disregard.

Note 2: Section 103-25 tells you when the choice must be made.

(2) However, the choice must be made in a way that ensures that:

(a) for an individual—your * CGT retirement exemption limit is
not exceeded; or

(b) for a company or trust—the CGT retirement exemption limit
of each individual for whom the choice is made is not
exceeded.

(3) The amount chosen for the asset is its **_CGT exempt amount_** .

(4) The * CGT exempt amount must be specified in writing.

(5) If a company or trust is making the choice and it has more than one
* CGT concession stakeholder, it must specify in writing the
percentage of each * CGT asset’s * CGT exempt amount that is
attributable to each of those stakeholders. One or more of the
percentages may be nil, but all of the percentages must add up to
100%.

Example: Daryl is a significant individual in a company. The company specifies
90% for Daryl under subsection (5) (which means that the percentage

exemption limit is $500,000.

To determine whether subsection (2) is complied with, Daryl would
take 90% of the asset’s CGT exempt amount, add that to amounts
previously specified in choices made by or for him under this
Subdivision and see whether the total exceeds $500,000.

Note: Subsections (4) and (5) are exceptions to the general rule about
choices in section 103-25.

##### 152-320  Meaning of **_CGT retirement exemption limit_**

(1) An individual’s **_CGT retirement exemption limit_** at a time is
$500,000 reduced by the * CGT exempt amounts of * CGT assets
specified in choices previously made by or for the individual under
this Subdivision.

Note: The $500,000 is also reduced by any reduction under old provisions
about reduction of the CGT retirement exemption limit: see item 62 of
Schedule 1 to the _New Business Tax System (Capital Gains Tax) Act_
_1999_ .

(2) If the individual was one of at least 2 * CGT concession
stakeholders of a company or trust, and the company or trust made
a choice for the individual, only the individual’s percentage (see
subsection 152-315(5)) of the assets’ * CGT exempt amounts is
taken into account under subsection (1) for that choice.

##### 152-325  Company or trust conditions

_Company or trust to make payments_

(1) A company or trust must make a payment (whether directly or
indirectly through one or more interposed entities) to at least one of
its * CGT concession stakeholders if:

to disregard a * capital gain from * CGT event J2, J5 or J6; or

(b) the company or trust receives an amount of * capital proceeds
from a * CGT event for which it makes a choice under this
Subdivision.

(3A) If the * CGT concession stakeholder to whom the payment is made
is an employee of the company or trust, the payment must not be of

satisfied for the gain.

Note 1: You can choose the roll-over even if you have not yet acquired a
replacement asset or incurred fourth element expenditure, but:

period, you do not acquire the asset or incur the expenditure (see
section 104-197); and

(b) CGT event J6 happens if, by the end of the replacement asset
period, the cost of the replacement asset or the amount of fourth
element expenditure incurred (or both) is less than the amount of
the capital gain that you disregarded (see section 104-198).

expenditure but there is a change in relation to the replacement asset
or improved asset after the end of the replacement asset period, CGT

##### Section 152-420

Note: If you choose to disregard only some of the capital gain, you make a
capital gain equal to the remaining amount.

Example: The original capital gain was $100,000. You have reduced it to
$25,000 under other concessions (apart from the roll-over). If you
choose to disregard $20,000, you are left with a final capital gain of
$5,000.

##### 152-420  Rules where an individual who has obtained a roll-over dies

(1) This section applies if:

(a) a replacement asset, or an asset in relation to which * fourth
element expenditure has been incurred, formed part of the
estate of an individual who has died; and

(b) either or both of the following apply:

(i) the asset has devolved to the deceased’s * legal personal
representative;

(ii) the asset has * passed to a beneficiary of the deceased;
and

(c) a change covered by subsection 104-185(2) or (3) did not
happen while the deceased owned it or, if the asset has
passed to a beneficiary, while the asset was in the hands of
the deceased’s legal personal representative.

(2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, anything done or not done by
the deceased in relation to the asset is treated as though it had been
done or not done by the * legal personal representative.

(3) For the purposes of this Subdivision, if the asset has * passed to a
beneficiary, anything done or not done by the deceased or by the
deceased’s * legal personal representative (including because of the
operation of subsection (2)) in relation to the asset is treated as
though it had been done or not done by the beneficiary.

##### 160-1  What this Division is about

A corporate tax entity can choose to “carry back” a tax loss it had
for 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22 or 2022-23 against the income tax
liability it had for 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 or 2021-22.

The entity gets a refundable tax offset for 2020-21, 2021-22 or
2022-23 that is a proxy for the tax the entity would save if it
deducted the loss in the income year to which the loss is “carried
back”.

The refundable tax offset:

(a) is capped at the entity’s franking account balance; and

(b) is only available for losses for years for which the
entity’s turnover was less than $5 billion.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions **Part 3-5**

Corporate loss carry back tax offset for 2020-21, 2021-22 or 2022-23 for businesses
with turnover under $5 billion **Division 160**

##### Section 160-10

Note: Do not reduce the step 1 amount by the entity’s net
exempt income to the extent the net exempt income has
already been utilised: see section 960-20.

Step 3. Multiply the step 2 amount by the * corporate tax rate for
the * loss year.

Example: Company A (which is not a base rate entity) has at the end of the
2020-21 income year:
(a) a tax loss of $900,000 for that year and a franking account
balance of $280,000; and

(b) for the 2018-19 income year—an income tax liability of
$120,000 and net exempt income of $5,000; and

(c) for the 2019-20 income year—an income tax liability of
$210,000.

Company A chooses to carry back $405,000 of its tax loss for the
2020-21 year to the 2018-19 year and $495,000 of that loss to the
2019-20 year.

Company A’s loss carry back tax offset for the 2020-21 year is
$268,500, worked out as follows:
(a) an offset component for the 2018-19 income year of $120,000,
calculated by starting with the $405,000 carried back, reducing
that at step 2 by $5,000, and multiplying the result by 30%;

(b) an offset component for the 2019-20 income year of $148,500,
calculated by starting with the $495,000 carried back and
multiplying the result by 30%.

The sum of the 2 components is $268,500 (which is less than
Company A’s $280,000 franking account balance at the end of the
2020-21 year). If that sum had exceeded that balance, the amount of
the offset would have been limited under paragraph (1)(b) of this
section to that balance.

_Income tax liability for the 2018-19 or 2019-20 income year_
_already utilised—entitlement to loss carry back tax offset for_
_2021-22 income year_

(3) Subsection (4) applies in relation to applying paragraph (2)(b) to
work out the entity’s * loss carry back tax offset component for the
2018-19 or 2019-20 income year (the **_gain year_** ) as part of working
out the entity’s entitlement to a * loss carry back tax offset for the
2021-22 income year.

##### Section 164-1

### Division 164—Non-share capital accounts for companies

#### Guide to Division 164

##### 164-1  What this Division is about

A company that issues non-share equity interests will have a
notional account called a **_non-share capital account_** . This account
records contributions to the company in relation to those non-share
equity interests and returns made by the company of those
contributions.

A non-share distribution that represents a return of contributions is
not taxed as a dividend (subject to the anti-avoidance provisions
dealing with dividend substitution). In certain circumstances a
company may use its share capital account as the source for such
distributions.

(1) The company calculates its taxable income for the income year in
this way:

_Method statement_

Step 1. Divide the income year into periods: each change in
ownership or control is a dividing point between periods.

Step 2. Treat each period as if it were an income year and work
out the notional loss or notional taxable income for that
period.

Step 3. Work out the taxable income for the year of the change
by adding up:

- each notional taxable income; and

- any full year amounts (amounts of assessable
income not taken into account at Step 2);

and then subtracting any full year deductions (deductions
not taken into account at Step 2).

Note: Do _not_ take into account any notional loss.

(2) As well as a taxable income, the company will have a tax loss. It is
the total of:

- each notional loss; and

#### When a company must work out its taxable income and tax loss
#### under this Subdivision

##### 165-35  On a change of ownership, unless the company satisfies the
##### business continuity test

A company must calculate its taxable income and * tax loss under
this Subdivision unless:

(a) there are persons who had * more than a 50% stake in the
company during the whole of the income year; or

Note: See section 165-220 for a special alternative to the condition in
this paragraph.

(b) there is only _part_ of the income year (a part that started at the
start of the income year) during which the same persons had
* more than a 50% stake in the company, but the company
satisfies the * business continuity test for the _rest_ of the
income year (the **_business continuity test period_** ); or

(c) the company was a * designated infrastructure project entity
during the whole of the income year.

Note: See subsection 415-35(7) if there is only part of the income year
during which the company was a designated infrastructure
project entity.

For the purposes of paragraph (b), apply the business continuity
test to the * business that the company carried on immediately
before the time (the **_test time_** ) when that part ended.

Note 1: For the business continuity test, see Subdivision 165-E.

Note 2: In the case of a widely held or eligible Division 166 company,
Subdivision 166-B modifies how this Subdivision applies, unless the
company chooses otherwise.

##### Section 165-37

(a) there are persons who had * more than 50% of the voting
power in the company during the whole of a period (the
**_ownership test period_** ) consisting of the income year or a part
of it; and

(b) there are persons who had rights to * more than 50% of the
company’s dividends during the whole of the ownership test
period; and

(c) there are persons who had rights to * more than 50% of the
company’s capital distributions during the whole of the
ownership test period;

those persons had **_more than a 50% stake_** in the company during
the ownership test period.

Note: Division 167 has special rules for working out rights to voting power,
dividends and capital distributions in a company whose shares do not
all carry the same rights to those matters.

(2) To work out whether a condition in subsection (1) was satisfied
during the * ownership test period, apply the primary test for that
condition unless subsection (3) requires the alternative test to be
applied.

For the primary tests: see subsections 165-150(1), 165-155(1)
and 165-160(1).

(3) Apply the alternative test for that condition if one or more other
companies beneficially owned * shares, or interests in shares, in the
company at any time during the * ownership test period.

For the alternative tests: see subsections 165-150(2), 165-155(2)
and 165-160(2).

_Conditions in subsection (1) may be treated as having been_
_satisfied in certain circumstances_

(4) If any of the conditions in subsection (1) have not been satisfied,
those conditions are taken to have been satisfied if:

(a) they would have been satisfied except for the operation of
section 165-165; and

(b) the company has information from which it would be
reasonable to conclude that less than 50% of the * notional

deductions, capital losses, or reduced assessable income, that
occurred, or could occur in future, because of the happening
of any * CGT event in relation to any * direct equity interests
or * indirect equity interests in the company during that
period.

(4A) If the company is:

(a) a * non-profit company; or

(b) a * mutual affiliate company; or

(c) a * mutual insurance company;

during the whole of the * ownership test period, the conditions in
paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) are taken to have been satisfied by the
company.

_Time of happening of CGT event_

(5) The happening of a * CGT event in relation to a * direct equity
interest or * indirect equity interest in the company that results in
the failure of the company to satisfy a condition in subsection (1) is
taken, for the purposes of paragraph (4)(b), to have occurred during
the * ownership test period.

##### 165-40  On a change of control of the voting power in the company,

control, or becomes able to control, the voting power in the
company (whether directly, or indirectly through one or more
interposed entities) for the purpose, or for purposes including the
purpose, of:

(a) getting some benefit or advantage in relation to how this Act
applies; or

(b) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else.

Note 1: A person can still control the voting power in a company that is in
liquidation etc.: see section 165-250.

##### Section 165-45

Note 2: Subdivision 167-B has special rules for working out voting power in a
company whose shares do not all carry the same voting rights, or do
not carry all of the voting rights in the company.

(2) However, that person’s control of the voting power, or ability to
control it, does not require the company to calculate its taxable
income under this Subdivision if the company satisfies the
* business continuity test for the _rest_ of the income year (the
**_business continuity test period_** ).

(3) Apply the * business continuity test to the * business that the
company carried on immediately before the time (the **_test time_** )
when the person began to control that voting power, or became
able to control it.

For the business continuity test: see Subdivision 165-E.

#### Working out the company’s taxable income

##### 165-45  First, divide the income year into periods

(1) Divide the income year into periods as follows.

(2) The first period starts at the start of the income year. Each later
period starts immediately after the end of the previous period.

(3) The last period ends at the end of the income year. Each period
(except the last) ends at the _earlier_ of:

(a) the _latest_ time that would result in persons having * more than
a 50% stake in the company during the whole of the period;
or

(b) the _earliest_ time when a person begins to control, or becomes
able to control, the voting power in the company (whether
directly, or indirectly  through one or more interposed entities)
for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of:

(i) getting some benefit or advantage to do with how this
Act applies; or

(ii) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else.

Note: See section 165-255 for the rule about incomplete periods.

##### Section 165-50

(4) However, what would otherwise be 2 or more successive periods
are treated as a single period if the company satisfies the * business
continuity test for all of them, considered as a single period (the
**_business continuity test period_** ). Apply the business continuity test
to the * business the company carried on immediately before the
end of the first of the periods (the **_test time_** ).

Note 1: For the business continuity test, see Subdivision 165-E.

Note 2: See section 165-225 for a special alternative to subsections (3) and (4)
of this section.

##### 165-50  Next, calculate the notional loss or notional taxable income
##### for each period

(1) The company has a * notional loss for a period if the deductions
attributed to the period under section 165-55 exceed the assessable
income attributed to the period under section 165-60. The **_notional_**
**_loss_** is the amount of the excess.

For a period during which the company was in partnership,
the notional loss is worked out under section 165-75.

(2) On the other hand, if that assessable income exceeds those
deductions, the company has a **_notional taxable income_** for the
period, equal to the excess.

For a period during which the company was in partnership,
the notional taxable income is worked out under section 165-75.

(3) If the company has a * notional loss for _none_ of the periods in the
income year, this Subdivision has no further application, and the
company’s taxable income for the income year is calculated in the
usual way.

The usual way of working out taxable income is set out in section 4-15.

##### 165-55  How to attribute deductions to periods

(1) The company’s deductions for the income year are attributed to
periods in the income year as follows.

(5) These are **_full year deductions_** :

(a) deductions for bad debts under section 8-1 (about general
deductions) or section 25-35 (about bad debts);

(b) deductions for losses on debt/equity swaps under section 63E
of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ ;

(c) deductions, so far as they are allowable under Division 8
(which is about deductions) because Subdivision H (Period
of deductibility of certain advance expenditure) of Division 3
of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ applies to
the company in relation to the income year;

(fa) deductions for payments of pensions, gratuities or retiring
allowances under section 25-50;

##### 165-60  How to attribute assessable income to periods

(1) The company’s assessable income for the income year is attributed
to periods in the income year as follows.

(2) The following amounts are attributed to periods so far as they are
reasonably attributable to those periods:

(a) amounts included in the company’s assessable income under
section 97 (Beneficiary of a trust estate who is not under a
legal disability) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ ; or

(b) amounts included in the company’s assessable income under
section 98A (Non-resident beneficiaries assessable in respect
of certain income) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

(2A) However, so much of an amount included in the company’s
assessable income under section 97 or 98A of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ as is a * capital gain that forms part of a * net
capital gain is not attributed to a period.

(3) The following items of assessable income are attributed to each
period in proportion to the length of the period:

(a) insurance recoveries for loss of * live stock or trees;

See section 385-130.

(b) amounts included in assessable income as a result of
elections relating to the forced disposal of live stock;

See Subdivision 385-E and section 385-160.

(c) recoupment of mains electricity connection expenditure.

clip) is attributed to the period when the wool would ordinarily
have been shorn.

(5) An amount included in the company’s assessable income that is a
* dividend under:

(a) section 65 (Payments to associated persons); or
(c) section 109 (Excessive payments to shareholders and
associates);

of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ is attributed to the period
when the amount was paid or credited, whichever occurred first.

(6) All other items of assessable income (except * full year amounts)
are attributed to periods as if each period were an income year.

(6A) A * net capital gain is not attributed to a period.

Note: This is because Subdivision 165-CB provides for how the company
must work out its net capital gain for the income year.

(7) **_Full year amounts_** are amounts referred to in paragraphs (2)(a) and
(b), so far as they are _not_ reasonably attributable to a period, but do
not include any part of a * capital gain that forms part of a * net
capital gain. Full year amounts are brought in at a later stage of the
process of calculating the company’s taxable income for the
income year.

##### 165-65  How to calculate the company’s taxable income for the
##### income year

(1) The company’s **_taxable income_** for the income year is calculated as

by

- the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

and expressing the result as a percentage.

(4) However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a

interest in the partnership.

##### 165-85  How to calculate the company’s share of a partnership’s
##### notional loss or notional net income for a period if the
##### entities have different income years

(1) This section applies if at any time during a period the company is a
partner in a partnership that has an income year that starts and ends
at a different time from when the company’s income year starts
and ends.

(2) So much of the partnership’s net income or partnership loss of an
income year as was * derived during the period is a **_notional net_**
**_income_** or **_notional loss_** of the partnership for the period. (For the
purposes of this subsection, the partnership’s net income or
partnership loss is calculated without taking account of the
partnership’s * full year deductions for that income year.)

Note: The partnership’s full year deductions are dealt with in
section 165-90.

(3) The **_company’s share_** is calculated by dividing:

- the company’s interest in the partnership’s net income or
partnership loss of that income year;

by

- the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

and expressing the result as a percentage.

##### Section 165-90

##### 165-90  Company’s full year deductions include a share of
##### partnership’s full year deductions

(1) This section applies if at any time during the income year the
company is a partner in a partnership that has one or more * full
year deductions for the income year of the partnership that
corresponds to the income year of the company.

(2) The partnership’s * full year deductions are treated as full year
deductions of the company, but only to the extent of the
* company’s share.

(3) If the partnership’s income year is the same as the company’s, the
**_company’s share_** is calculated by dividing:

- the company’s interest in the partnership’s net income or
partnership loss of the income year;

by

- the amount of that net income or partnership loss;

and expressing the result as a percentage.

(4) However, if the partnership had neither a net income nor a

and reasonable having regard to the extent of the company’s
interest in the partnership.

(5) If the partnership’s income year does not start and end at the same
time as the company’s income year, the **_company’s share_** is a
percentage that is fair and reasonable having regard to all relevant
circumstances.

under section 102-5.

Note 2: Subdivision 165-A deals with the deductibility of a company’s tax
loss for an earlier income year if there has been a change in the

loss year to the end of the income year.

Note 3: Subdivision 165-F may affect the application of Subdivision 165-A.

(2) If subsection (1) prevents the company from applying the * net
capital loss, it can apply the _part_ of the loss that it made during a
_part_ of that earlier income year, but only if, assuming that part of
that income year had been treated as the whole of it, the company
would have been entitled to apply the net capital loss.

**_net capital gain_** is the amount of the excess.

(2) On the other hand, if the total of those losses exceeds the total of
those gains, the company has a **_notional net capital loss_** for the
period, equal to the excess.

(3) If the company has a * notional net capital loss for none of the

application, and the company’s * net capital gain for the income
year is calculated in the usual way.

The usual way of working out the net capital gain is set out in section 102-5.

account, but counts towards the company’s net capital
loss for the income year.

#### Subdivision 165-CC—Change of ownership or control of
#### company that has an unrealised net loss

#### Guide to Subdivision 165-CC

##### 165-115  What this Subdivision is about

If a change occurs in the ownership or control of a company that
has an unrealised net loss, the company cannot, to the extent of the
unrealised net loss, have capital losses taken into account, or
deduct revenue losses, in respect of CGT events that happen to
CGT assets that it owned at the time of the change, unless it
satisfies the business continuity test.

##### 165-115AA  Special rules to save compliance costs

(1) A company is exempt from these rules if, at the time of the change
in ownership or control, it (together with certain related entities)
has a net asset value of not more than $6,000,000 under the test in
section 152-15 (for small business CGT relief).

(2) In working out whether it has an unrealised net loss, a company
can choose to work out the market value of each of its assets
individually, or of all of its assets together.

(3) If a company works out the market value of each of its assets
individually, it may choose to exclude every asset that it acquired
for less than $10,000, in which case:

(a) unrealised losses and gains on the excluded assets will not be
taken into account in calculating the company’s unrealised
net loss; and

(b) losses on the excluded assets will be allowed without the
company being subject to the business continuity test.

trading stock loss, the amount of the trading stock loss is to be
included in the company’s assessable income.

_Where trading stock loss is greater than unrealised net loss_

(3) If the * trading stock loss is greater than the company’s residual
unrealised net loss at the time of the occurrence of the trading stock
loss, the part of the trading stock loss that is equal to the residual
unrealised net loss is to be included in the company’s assessable
income.

##### Section 165-115BB

_No increase in assessable income if company satisfies the business_
_continuity test_

(4) Neither subsection (2) nor (3) applies to the company if the
company meets the condition in section 165-13 (the business
continuity test).

_Assumptions for purposes of business continuity test_

(5) In determining whether the company meets the condition in
section 165-13, assume:

(a) that the * trading stock loss (if subsection (2) applies) or the
part of the trading stock loss (if subsection (3) applies) is a
* net capital loss of the company for the income year
immediately before the income year in which the changeover
time occurred; and

(b) that the company failed, at the changeover time, to meet the
condition in subsections 165-12(2), (3) and (4) in relation to
the net capital loss referred to in paragraph (a); and

(c) that the changeover time is the **_test time_** ; and

(d) that the * business continuity test period is the income year in
which the loss occurred.

_Order in which assets are to be applied_

(1) In applying subsection 165-115B(2) or 165-115BA(3) in respect of
assets that the company owned at the changeover time:

(a) the company’s * capital losses are taken to have been made,
the company is taken to have become entitled to deductions
and the company is taken to have made * trading stock losses
in the order in which the events that resulted in the capital
losses, deductions or trading stock losses occurred; and

(b) if 2 or more such events occurred at the same time, they are
taken to have occurred in such order as the company
determines.

_Residual unrealised net loss_

(2) The company’s **_residual unrealised net loss_** , at the time of an
event (the **_relevant event_** ) that resulted in the company making a
* capital loss, becoming entitled to a deduction or making a * trading
stock loss, in respect of an asset, is the amount worked out using
the following formula:

Previous capital losses, deductions
Unrealised net loss –
or trading stock losses

where:

**_previous capital losses, deductions or trading stock losses_** means
the total of the following:

(a) capital losses that the company made, deductions to which
the company became entitled, or * trading stock losses that the
company made, as a result of events earlier than the relevant
event in respect of assets that the company owned at the
* changeover time;

(b) each reduction that section 715-105 (as applying to the
company as the * head company of a * consolidated group or
* MEC group) makes in respect of such an asset because an
entity ceased before the time of the relevant event to be a
* subsidiary member of the group (but counting only the
greater or greatest such reduction if 2 or more are made for
the same asset);

or nil if there are none.

**_unrealised net loss_** means the company’s unrealised net loss at the
last changeover time that occurred before the relevant event.

Note: For **_changeover time_** see sections 165-115C and 165-115D.

##### Section 165-115C

##### 165-115C  Changeover time—change in ownership of company

(1) A time (the **_test time_** ) is a **_changeover time_** in respect of a company
if:

(a) persons who had * more than 50% of the voting power in the
company at the reference time do not have more than 50% of
that voting power immediately after the test time; or

(b) persons who had rights to * more than 50% of the company’s
dividends at the reference time do not have rights to more
than 50% of those dividends immediately after the test time;
or

(c) persons who had rights to * more than 50% of the company’s
capital distributions at the reference time do not have rights
to more than 50% of those distributions immediately after the
test time.

Note 1: See section 165-150 to work out who had more than 50% of the
voting power in the company.

Note 2: See section 165-155 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of
the company’s dividends.

Note 3: See section 165-160 to work out who had rights to more than 50% of
the company’s capital distributions.

Note 4: For **_reference time_** see subsection 165-115A(2A).

Note 5: Division 167 has special rules for working out rights to voting power,
dividends and capital distributions in a company whose shares do not
all carry the same rights to those matters.

(2) To work out whether paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) applied at a
particular time, apply the primary test unless subsection (3)
requires the alternative test to be applied.

Note: For the primary test see subsections 165-150(1), 165-155(1) and
165-160(1).

(3) Apply the alternative test if one or more other companies
beneficially owned * shares or interests in shares in the company at
any time during the period from the reference time to the * test time.

Note: For the alternative test see subsections 165-150(2), 165-155(2) and

##### Section 165-115D

(4) A * test time that would, apart from this subsection, be a
changeover time in respect of the company because of the
application of subsection (1) is taken not to be a changeover time
if:

(a) that subsection would not have applied except for the
operation of section 165-165; and

(b) the company has information from which it would be
reasonable to conclude that less than 50% of the company’s
unrealised net loss at the test time has been reflected in
deductions, capital losses, or reduced assessable income, that
occurred, or could occur in future, because of the happening
of any * CGT event in relation to any * direct equity interests
or * indirect equity interests in the company during the period
from the reference time to the test time.

(4A) If the company is:

(a) a * non-profit company; or

(b) a * mutual affiliate company; or

(c) a * mutual insurance company;

during the whole of the period from the reference time to the * test
time, the test time is taken not to be a * changeover time in respect
of the company because of the application of paragraphs (1)(b) and
(c).

(5) The happening of any * CGT event in relation to a * direct equity
interest or * indirect equity interest in the company that results in
the time of the happening of the event being a changeover time in
respect of the company is taken, for the purposes of
paragraph (4)(b), to have occurred during the period referred to in
that paragraph.

power immediately after the test time; and

(b) that person or those persons so began, or became able, to
control that voting power for the purpose of:

(i) getting some benefit or advantage in relation to how this
Act applies; or

(ii) getting such a benefit or advantage for someone else;

or for purposes including that purpose.

Note 1: A person can still control the voting power in a company that is in

Note 2: Subdivision 167-B has special rules for working out voting power in a
company whose shares do not all carry the same voting rights, or do
not carry all of the voting rights in the company.

(2) In this section:

**_control_** of the voting power in a company means control of that
voting power either directly, or indirectly through one or more
interposed entities.

##### 165-115E  What is an unrealised net loss

(1) The question whether a company has an **_unrealised net loss_** at a
particular time (the **_relevant time_** ) is worked out in this way (the
**_individual asset method_** ), unless the company chooses to work it
out using the * global method (set out in subsection (2)).

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out under section 165-115F in respect of each
* CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time
any notional capital gain or notional revenue gain or any
notional capital loss or notional revenue loss that the
company has at that time in respect of the asset.

The sum of the notional capital gains is the company’s
**_unrealised capital gain_** at the relevant time.

The sum of the notional capital losses is the company’s
**_unrealised capital loss_** at the relevant time.

The sum of the notional revenue gains is the company’s
**_unrealised revenue gain_** at the relevant time.

The sum of the notional revenue losses is the company’s
**_unrealised revenue loss_** at the relevant time.

Step 2. Add up the unrealised capital gain and the unrealised
revenue gain at the relevant time. The total is the
**_unrealised gross gain_** at that time.

Step 3. Add up the unrealised capital loss and the unrealised
revenue loss at the relevant time. The total is the
**_unrealised gross loss_** at that time.

Step 4. If the unrealised gross loss at the relevant time exceeds
the unrealised gross gain at that time, the excess is the
company’s **_preliminary unrealised net loss_** at that time.

Step 5. Add up the company’s preliminary unrealised net loss
and any * capital loss, deduction or share of a deduction
disregarded under section 170-270 in relation to an asset
referred to in paragraph 165-115A(1A)(b). The total is
the company’s **_unrealised net loss_** at the relevant time.

##### Section 165-115E

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the total * market value of all * CGT assets that
the company owned at the relevant time (including those
it * acquired for less than $10,000), using a valuation
method that would generally be regarded as appropriate
in the circumstances.

Step 2. Work out the total of the * cost bases of those * CGT assets
at the relevant time.

Note: If a CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant
time was also trading stock or a revenue asset at that
time, see subsection (3) of this section.

Step 3. If the step 2 amount exceeds the step 1 amount, the
excess is the company’s **_preliminary unrealised net loss_** 
at the relevant time.

Step 4. Add up the company’s preliminary unrealised net loss
and any * capital loss, deduction or share of a deduction
disregarded under section 170-270 in relation to an asset
referred to in paragraph 165-115A(1A)(b). The total is
the company’s **_unrealised net loss_** at the relevant time.

(3) If:

(a) a * CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant time
was also * trading stock or a * revenue asset at that time; and

(b) the asset’s * cost base at the relevant time is _less than_ the
amount that would be compared under section 165-115F with
the asset’s * market value in working out a notional revenue
gain or notional revenue loss that the company has at the
relevant time in respect of the asset;

then, for the purposes of step 2 of the method statement in
subsection (2) of this section, the amount that would be so
compared is to be taken into account _instead of_ that cost base.

for the income year in which the relevant time occurred; or

(b) such later day as the Commissioner allows.

##### 165-115F  Notional gains and losses

(1) This section applies for the purpose of calculating whether a
company has at a particular time (the **_relevant time_** ) a notional
capital gain, a notional capital loss, a notional revenue gain or a
notional revenue loss in respect of a * CGT asset that it owned at
that time.

(2) The calculation is to be made on the assumption that the company
disposed of the asset at its * market value at the relevant time.

(3) In relation to an asset other than an item of * trading stock:

(a) if the company would make a * capital gain in respect of the
disposal of the asset—the company has at the relevant time in
respect of the asset a **_notional capital gain_** equal to the
amount of the capital gain; or

(b) if an amount (other than a capital gain) would be included in
the company’s assessable income in respect of the disposal of
the asset—the company has at the relevant time in respect of
the asset a **_notional revenue gain_** equal to the amount so
included; or

(c) if the company would make a * capital loss in respect of the
disposal of the asset—the company has at the relevant time in
respect of the asset a **_notional capital loss_** equal to the
amount of the capital loss; or

(d) if the company would be entitled to a deduction in respect of
the disposal of the asset—the company has at the relevant
time in respect of the asset a **_notional revenue loss_** equal to
the amount of the deduction.

Income tax consequences of changing ownership or control of a company **Division 165**

##### Section 165-115GA

#### Subdivision 165-CD—Reductions after alterations in ownership
#### or control of loss company

#### Guide to Subdivision 165-CD

##### 165-115GA  What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision prevents multiple recognition of a company’s
losses when significant equity and debt interests that entities (not
individuals) have in the company are realised.

##### 165-115GB  When adjustments must be made

(1) The operation of this Subdivision is triggered at an alteration time,
which is when:

(a) an alteration takes place in the ownership or control of the
company; or

(b) a liquidator or administrator of the company declares that
shares or financial instruments are worthless (CGT event
G3).

(2) An alteration time is the trigger for making reductions and other
adjustments to the reduced cost base of significant equity and debt
interests in the company that are owned by an entity (not an
individual) that, alone or with its associates, has a controlling stake
in the company and either:

(a) has a * direct equity interest or * indirect equity interest of at
least 10% in the company; or

(b) is owed a debt of at least $10,000 by the company or by
another entity that has a significant equity or debt interest in
the company.

Deductions that relate to such interests held as trading stock or
otherwise on revenue account are also reduced.

(3) Adjustments may also be made when such an entity’s interests in
the company are partly realised within 12 months before an

alteration time or if, under an arrangement, such interests are
realised partly within that period or at the alteration time and partly
at an earlier time.

(4) However, entities in which there are no interests in respect of
which the company’s losses have been, or can be, duplicated are
not affected by this Subdivision.

##### 165-115GC  How adjustments are calculated

(1) Adjustments are based on the overall loss of the company. This
comprises its realised losses and unrealised losses on CGT assets.

(2) Special rules, directed at saving compliance costs, apply to
determine whether unrealised losses have to be counted at an
alteration time and, if so, how to work them out.

(3) The company may not have to calculate its unrealised losses if the
alteration time is not also a changeover time for the purposes of
Subdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a
company that has an unrealised net loss), and the company has no
realised losses.

(4) The company does not have to count unrealised losses at an
alteration time if (together with certain related entities) it has a net
asset value of not more than $6,000,000 under the test in
section 152-15 (for small business CGT relief).

(5) In working out its unrealised losses on CGT assets, the company
can choose to work out the * market value of each of its assets
individually, or of all of its assets together.

(6) If the company works out the * market value of each of its assets
individually, unrealised losses on assets acquired for less than
$10,000 do not have to be calculated at any time.

(7) Amounts (whether realised or unrealised) counted at a previous
alteration time are not counted again at a later alteration time. (This
does not apply to unrealised losses worked out by reference to the
* market value of all the company’s assets together.)

Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions **Part 3-5**

Income tax consequences of changing ownership or control of a company **Division 165**

##### Section 165-115H

(8) However, if unrealised amounts are _not_ counted at a previous
alteration time (for example, because of the $10,000 exclusion, or
because you satisfy the maximum net asset value test in
section 152-15) and are not required to be taken into account in
adjustments made at that time, they may be counted at a later time
as part of a realised loss.

(9) A formula is provided for making adjustments in straightforward
cases if applying the formula gives a reasonable result having
regard to the object of the Subdivision. Otherwise, reasonable
adjustments must be made having regard to a number of stated
factors.

(10) To help entities to make the adjustments, any entity that, in its own
right, has a controlling stake in the company is required to provide
a written notice to its associates setting out relevant information. In
limited circumstances, the company itself may have to provide a
written notice to entities that, to its knowledge, have a significant
equity or debt interest in it.

##### 165-115H  How this Subdivision applies

(1) This Subdivision provides for certain taxation consequences for an
entity (not an individual) that had a significant equity or debt
interest in a loss company immediately before an alteration time
occurred in respect of the company.

(2) The following flowchart explains how to work out whether this
Subdivision applies to an entity.

##### Section 165-115H

**Application of Subdivision**

**Has an alteration time occurred in respect of a company?**
This happens in the event of:

No

-an alteration in ownership (see section 165-115L)
-an alteration in control (see section 165-115M)
-a declaration by a liquidator or administrator (see section

165-115N)

-certain other circumstances (see sections 165-115P and

165-115Q)
except where the alteration, or other circumstances, are to be
disregarded (see subsections 165-115K(2) and (4)).

Yes

No

**Was the company a loss company at the alteration time?**
This happens if the company had realised or unrealised
losses. To work this out see sections 165-115R to 165-115W.

Yes

No

**The Subdivision does**
**not apply to the entity.**

**Is there an entity (not an individual) that had a relevant**
**equity or debt interest in the loss company immediately**
**before the alteration time?**
To work this out see sections 165-115X to 165-115Z.

Yes

**The Subdivision applies to the entity.**

(3) If this Subdivision applies to an entity, reductions are made to:

(a) the reduced cost base of the entity’s equity or debt (see
subsection 165-115ZA(3)); or

(b) any deduction to which the entity is entitled in respect of the
disposal of the equity or debt (see subsection 165-115ZA(4));
or

(c) deductions in respect of, and the cost of, any of the equity or
debt that is trading stock (see subsection 165-115ZA(5)).

Example: The following is an example of how this Subdivision operates:

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions **Part 3-5**

Income tax consequences of changing ownership or control of a company **Division 165**

##### Section 165-115H

Facts: Alpha Co acquired 80% of the shares in Beta Co on 5 May 1998 for
$1,000.

Gamma Co owns 20% of the shares in Beta Co.

On 6 February 2000, Alpha Co disposed of its shares for $600.

At the beginning of the 1999-2000 income year, Beta Co had an
unapplied net capital loss of $500 from the 1998-99 income year. This
loss was fully reflected in the market value of shares in Beta Co.

Alpha Co and Gamma Co are not associated in any way.

Result:

Step 1: An alteration time occurred in respect of Beta Co as a result of the
change in ownership that occurred when Alpha Co sold its shares.

Step 2: Beta Co was a loss company at the alteration time because it had an
unapplied net capital loss from an earlier income year.

Step 3: Alpha Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co immediately before
the alteration time because it had a controlling stake and significant
interest (80% equity interest). Gamma Co did not have a relevant
equity interest in Beta Co because it did not have a controlling stake.

Step 4: Because Alpha Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co, the
reduced cost bases of its shares in Beta Co are reduced by 80% of
Beta Co’s net capital loss:

80% $500 $400  

Alpha Co does not make a capital gain on the disposal of its shares in
Beta Co because the capital proceeds ($600) are less than the cost
bases ($1,000).

Nor did Alpha Co make a capital loss on the disposal of its shares in
Beta Co because the capital proceeds ($600) are not less than the
reduced cost bases as further reduced by this Subdivision ($600).

The net capital loss in Beta Co is not duplicated on the sale of Alpha
Co’s shares in Beta Co.

Step 5. There are no notice requirements in this simple case. If Gamma Co
and Alpha Co were associates (so that Gamma Co had a relevant
equity interest in Beta Co), Alpha Co would need to provide the
following information to Gamma Co:
(a) the alteration time: 6 February 2000;

(b) Beta Co’s overall loss at the alteration time: $500;

(c) details of the overall loss: a net capital loss of $500 for the
1998-99 income year.

or control alters.
The purpose of the adjustments is to prevent the duplication of the
company’s realised and unrealised losses when any of those
interests are * disposed of or otherwise realised. This happens
because the company’s losses are reflected in the values of the
interests.

##### 165-115K  Application and interpretation

_Application_

(1) This Subdivision applies if:

(a) an alteration time occurs in respect of a company; and

(b) the company is a * loss company at the alteration time; and

(c) one or more entities had relevant equity interests or relevant
debt interests in the company immediately before the
alteration time.

Note 1: For **_alteration time_** , see sections 165-115L, 165-115M, 165-115N,
165-115P and 165-115Q.

Note 2: For **_relevant equity interests_** and **_relevant debt interests_** , see
sections 165-115X and 165-115Y.

_Alteration time before commencement time to be disregarded_

(2) An **_alteration time_** does not include a time before the
commencement time.

_Commencement time_

(3) The **_commencement time_** for a company is:

(a) if the company was in existence at 1 pm (by legal time in the
Australian Capital Territory) on 11 November 1999—that
time; or

(b) if the company came into existence after that time—the time
when it came into existence.

company under Subdivision 165-CC; and

(d) if the test time were such a changeover time, it would be
reasonable for the company to conclude that it would not
have an unrealised net loss at that time under
section 165-115E;

the test time is taken not to be an alteration time in relation to the
company.

_Application to CGT events other than disposals_

(5) This Subdivision applies to a * CGT event (other than a * disposal)
happening in relation to a CGT asset (for example, an interest in a
company that is constituted by an equity or debt):

(a) in the same way as it applies to a disposal of a CGT asset;
and

(b) as if the asset had been disposed of at the time when the CGT
event happens.

##### 165-115L  Alteration time—alteration in ownership of company

(1) A time (the **_test time_** ) is an **_alteration time_** in respect of a company
if:

(a) persons who had * more than 50% of the voting power in the
company at the reference time do not have more than 50% of
that voting power immediately after the test time; or

(b) persons who had rights to * more than 50% of the company’s

subsections 165-115ZB(3) and (6).

_Certain losses to be disregarded_

(6) A reference in a paragraph of subsection (3) and in the
corresponding paragraph of subsection (5) to a particular loss is a
reference only to a loss to the extent to which it represents an
outlay or loss of any of the economic resources of the company.

Note: Where the income tax law allows, as all or part of a loss, an amount
for the decline in value of a depreciating asset that exceeds the actual
economic depreciation or depletion of the asset concerned, the excess
is not to be regarded for the purposes of this subsection as
representing an outlay or loss of economic resources of the company.

(6A) Subsection (6) does not apply to paragraphs (3)(c) and (5)(c) if the
company has chosen to use the * global method of working out

_Amounts of losses may be reduced_

(7) The amounts referred to in paragraphs (5)(a) and (b) may be
reduced under section 165-115T.

##### 165-115T  Reduction of certain amounts included in company’s
##### overall loss at alteration time

(1) In working out under section 165-115R or 165-115S whether a

##### Section 165-115U

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out under section 165-115V or 165-115W in
respect of each * CGT asset that the company owned at
the relevant alteration time any notional capital loss,
notional revenue loss or trading stock decrease that the
company has at that time in respect of the asset.

To the extent that a notional capital loss or a notional
revenue loss in respect of an asset at the relevant
alteration time reflected an amount that was counted at an
earlier alteration time, do not count it again at the
relevant alteration time.

Step 2. Add up the notional capital losses and the notional
revenue losses that the company had at the relevant
alteration time. The total is the company’s **_nominal_**
**_unrealised loss_** at that time.

Step 3. Add up the trading stock decreases that the company had
at the relevant alteration time. The total is the company’s
**_overall trading stock decrease_** at that time.

Step 4. The sum of the company’s nominal unrealised loss and
overall trading stock decrease at the relevant time is the
company’s **_adjusted unrealised loss_** at that time.

Note: Certain alteration times are disregarded (see subsections 165-115K(2)
and (4)).

(1A) Step 1 in the method statement in subsection (1) does not apply to
an amount that was counted at an earlier alteration time if the
company has chosen to use the * global method of working out
whether it has an adjusted unrealised loss at that earlier time.

(1B) The **_global method_** of working out whether the company has an
**_adjusted unrealised loss_** at the relevant alteration time is as
follows:

##### Section 165-115U

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the total * market value of all * CGT assets that
the company owned at the relevant alteration time
(including those it * acquired for less than $10,000), using
a valuation method that would generally be regarded as
appropriate in the circumstances.

Step 2. Work out the total of the * cost bases of those * CGT assets
at the relevant time.

Note: If a CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant
time was also trading stock or a revenue asset at that
time, see subsection (1C) of this section.

Step 3. If the step 2 amount exceeds the step 1 amount, the
excess is the company’s **_adjusted unrealised loss_** at the
relevant time.

(1C) If:

(a) a * CGT asset that the company owned at the relevant
alteration time was also * trading stock or a * revenue asset at
that time; and

(b) the asset’s * cost base at the relevant alteration time is _less_
_than_ the amount that, if the relevant alteration time were a
changeover time, would be compared under
section 165-115F with the asset’s * market value in working
out a notional revenue gain or notional revenue loss that the
company would have at the changeover time in respect of the
asset;

then, for the purposes of step 2 of the method statement in
subsection (1B) of this section, the amount that would be so
compared is to be taken into account _instead of_ that cost base.

(1D) A choice to use the * global method must be made on or before:

(a) the day on which the company lodges its * income tax return
for the income year in which the relevant alteration time
occurred; or

##### Section 165-115V

(b) such later day as the Commissioner allows.

(2) However, the company does not have an adjusted unrealised loss at
the relevant alteration time if the company would, at that time,
satisfy the maximum net asset value test under section 152-15.

##### 165-115V  Notional losses

(1) This section applies for the purpose of calculating whether a
company has at an alteration time a notional capital loss or a
notional revenue loss in respect of a * CGT asset that it owned at
that time.

(2) However, a company does not have a notional capital loss or a
notional revenue loss at an alteration time in respect of a CGT asset
that it * acquired for less than $10,000.

(3) The calculation is to be made on the assumption that the company
disposed of the asset at its * market value at the alteration time.

(4) If the company would make a * capital loss in respect of the
disposal of the asset, the company has at the alteration time in
respect of the asset a **_notional capital loss_** equal to the amount of
the capital loss.

(5) If the company would be entitled to a deduction in respect of the
disposal of the asset, the company has at the alteration time in
respect of the asset a **_notional revenue loss_** equal to the amount of
the deduction.

(6) A company may choose that this section is to apply to the company
at the alteration time in respect of an asset to which subsection (7)
applied at that time as if the reference in subsection (3) to the
* market value of the asset were a reference to its * written down
value.

(7) This subsection applies to an asset at the alteration time if:

(a) the asset is a * depreciating asset (not a building or structure)
for whose decline in value the company has deducted or can
deduct an amount; and

##### Section 165-115W

(b) the expenditure incurred by the company to * acquire the asset
was less than $1,000,000 (the expenditure can include the
giving of property: see section 103-5); and

(c) it would be reasonable for the company to conclude that the
* market value of the asset at the alteration time was not less
than 80% of its * written down value at that time.

##### 165-115W  Calculation of trading stock decrease

(1) The question whether there is a **_trading stock decrease_** in relation
to a company at an alteration time for a * CGT asset of the company
that was an item of * trading stock at that time is worked out in this
way.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out whether the item’s * market value immediately
before the alteration time was less than:

(a) if there was no earlier alteration time in the income
year in which that alteration time occurred—the
item’s value under subsection 70-40(1) at the start
of that income year or its cost if
subsection 70-40(2) applies; or

(b) if there was an earlier alteration time or there were
earlier alteration times in that income year—the
item’s market value immediately before that earlier
alteration time or the later or latest of those earlier
alteration times, as the case may be, or its cost if
the company did not own it at that time.

Step 2. If the item’s * market value immediately before the
alteration time was less than:

(a) the item’s value or cost referred to in paragraph (a)
in step 1; or

(b) its market value or cost (as applicable) in
paragraph (b) in step 1;

as the case requires, the difference is the **_trading stock_**
**_decrease_** for the item.

To the extent (if any) to which the difference reflects an
amount counted at an earlier alteration time, do not count
that amount again.

Note: Certain alteration times are disregarded (see subsections 165-115K(2)
and (4)).

(1A) Step 2 in the method statement in subsection (1) does not apply to
an amount counted at an earlier alteration time if the company has
chosen to use the * global method of working out whether it has an
adjusted unrealised loss at that earlier time.

(2) However, a company does not have a trading stock decrease at an
alteration time in respect of an item of * trading stock that it
* acquired for less than $10,000.

##### 165-115X  Relevant equity interest

(1) An entity (not an individual) has a **_relevant equity interest_** in a
* loss company at a particular time if:

(a) at that time the entity has a controlling stake in the loss
company (see section 165-115Z); and

(b) at that time the entity has an interest (an **_equity_** ) that gives, or
interests (each of which is also called an **_equity_** ) that between
them give, the entity:

(i) the control of, or the ability to control, 10% or more of
the voting power in the loss company (either directly, or
indirectly through one or more interposed entities); or

(ii) the right to receive (either directly, or indirectly through
one or more interposed entities) 10% or more of any
dividends that the loss company may pay; or

(c) the equity or each equity is either:

(i) an interest (including a * share or shares, or an option or
right to acquire a share or shares) in the loss company;
or

(ii) an interest (including an option or right to acquire an
interest) held by the entity directly in another entity that

Note: For paragraph (b), Division 167 has special rules for working out
rights to voting power, dividends and capital distributions in a
company whose shares do not all carry the same rights to those
matters.

(2) The equity or equities constitute the entity’s relevant equity interest
in the * loss company.

(2A) A * widely held company that, apart from this subsection, would
have a relevant equity interest in a * loss company at a particular
time does not have such an interest at that time.

(2B) Subsection (2A) does not apply if:

(a) an entity has a controlling stake in the loss company (see
section 165-115Z); and

(b) that entity has a direct or indirect interest in, or is owed a
debt by, the * widely held company, being an interest or debt
in respect of which:

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-5** Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions
**Division 165** Income tax consequences of changing ownership or control of a company

##### Section 165-115ZA

Note 1: The effect of subsection (1) is that, if an entity has a controlling stake
in a company, each associate of the entity also has a controlling stake
in the company.

Note 2: Division 167 has special rules for working out rights to voting power,
dividends and capital distributions in a company whose shares do not
all carry the same rights to those matters.

(2) If:

(a) apart from this subsection, an interest that gives an entity and
its * associates (if any):

(i) the ability to exercise, or control the exercise of, any of
the voting power in a company; or

(ii) the right to receive dividends that a company may pay;
or

(iii) the right to receive a distribution of capital of a
company;

would, in the application of paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c), be
counted more than once; and

(b) the interest is both direct and indirect;

only the direct interest is to be counted.

##### 165-115ZA  Reductions and other consequences if entity has relevant
##### equity interest or relevant debt interest in loss company
##### immediately before alteration time

_Application of section_

(1) This section applies to an entity (an **_affected entity_** ) that has a
relevant equity interest or a relevant debt interest, or both, in a
* loss company immediately before a time (a **_relevant time_** ) that is
an alteration time in respect of the loss company.

Note: This section and section 165-115ZB can apply differently for a
company that has used the global method of working out whether it
has an adjusted unrealised loss at an alteration time. See
section 165-115ZD.

immediately before any previous relevant time;

the proceeds of the disposal are taken to be reduced by so much of

_Obligations of person not affected by failure to give notice_

(8) Any failure by an entity or the * loss company to give a notice to a
person under this section does not affect any obligation of the
person to comply with the requirements of this Subdivision.

##### 165-115ZD  Adjustment (or further adjustment) for interest realised
##### at a loss after global method has been used

(1) This section affects how sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB
apply to an interest (the **_equity_** ) in, or a debt owed by, a company
if, apart from this section, a loss (the **_realised loss_** ):

(a) would be * realised for income tax purposes by a * realisation
event that happens to the equity or debt; or

(b) would be so realised but for Subdivision 170-D (which defers
realisation of capital losses and deductions);

and the company chose to use the * global method of working out
whether it had an adjusted unrealised loss at the last alteration
time:

(c) that happened for the company before the realisation event;
and

(d) immediately before which the equity or debt was, or was part
of:

(i) if the company was a * loss company at that alteration
time—a relevant equity interest, or a relevant debt
interest, that an entity had in the company; or

(ii) otherwise—what would have been such an interest if the
company had been a loss company at that alteration
time.

Note: If that last alteration time is before the day on which the _New Business_
_Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other_
_Measures) Act 2002_ received the Royal Assent, the owner of the
equity or debt may choose to apply section 165-115ZD of the _Income_
_Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ instead of this section.

(a) the company had an adjusted unrealised loss at that time
worked out under this section; and

(b) the company were therefore a * loss company at that time; and

(c) that adjusted unrealised loss were the company’s overall loss
at that time.

(3) For the purposes of how sections 165-115ZA and 165-115ZB
apply because of this section, the adjustment amount under
section 165-115ZB is to be worked out and applied in accordance
with subsection 165-115ZB(6) (the non-formula method).

_Adjusted unrealised loss worked out under this section_

(4) The adjusted unrealised loss referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is
worked out using this method statement:

_Method statement_

Step 1. Add up the amount or value of each thing covered by
subsection (5). (If the total exceeds the realised loss,
reduce the total by the excess.)

Step 2. Reduce the step 1 amount by so much of the realised loss
as it is reasonable to conclude is attributable to _none_ of
these:

(a) a notional capital loss, or a notional revenue loss,
that the company has at that last alteration time in
respect of a * CGT asset;

(b) a trading stock decrease in relation to that time for
a CGT asset that was * trading stock of the
company at that time.

Note: If the equity or debt is a revenue asset, the realised loss is different
from the loss referred to in subsection (1): see subsection (9).

event:

(i) that happens, during the period referred to in subsection (6), to a
* CGT asset that the company owned at that last alteration time and

##### 166-1  What this Division is about

This Division modifies the way the rules in Division 165 apply to a
widely held or eligible Division 166 company by making it easier
for the company to apply the rules.

If the company has maintained the same owners as between certain
points of time, it does not need to prove it has maintained the same
owners throughout the periods in between.

In certain cases, special concessional tracing rules deem entities to
hold voting, dividend or capital stakes in the company so that the
company does not have to trace through to the ultimate beneficial
owners of the stakes.

##### Section 166-3

#### Subdivision 166-AA—The object of this Division

##### 166-3  The object of this Division

(1) The object of this Division is to make it easier for a * widely held
company, or an * eligible Division 166 company, to apply the rules
in Division 165 (because of the difficulty the company might have
under that Division in actually tracing through to the ultimate
beneficial owners of * voting stakes, * dividend stakes and * capital
stakes in the company).

(2) This Division makes it easier to apply the rules in Division 165 by:

(a) making it unnecessary for the company to prove that it has
maintained the same owners throughout a period, if the
company had the same owners at certain test times; and

(b) making it unnecessary for the company to trace through to
the ultimate beneficial owners of:

(i)  * voting stakes, * dividend stakes and * capital stakes in
the company held by certain entities (whether directly,
or * indirectly through one or more interposed entities);
and

(ii) small voting stakes, dividend stakes and capital stakes
in the company.

(1) This section modifies how the ownership tests in section 166-145
are applied to the tested company if:

(a) at the * ownership test time, it is the case, or it is reasonable to
assume, that persons (none of them companies or trustees)
hold a * voting stake, a * dividend stake or a * capital stake in
the tested company; and

(b) an entity has not, under section 166-225, 166-230, 166-240
or 166-245, been taken to control voting power or have rights
in respect of the stake; and

(c) another company (the **_foreign listed company_** ) is interposed,
at that time, between those persons and the tested company;
and

(d) at all times during the income year of the tested company in
which the ownership test time occurs, the * principal class of
shares in the foreign listed company is listed for quotation in
the official list of an * approved stock exchange; and

(e) at the ownership test time:

(i) voting stakes that carry rights to 50% or more of the
voting power in the foreign listed company; or

(ii) dividend stakes that carry rights to receive 50% or more
of any dividends that the foreign listed company may
pay; or

(iii) capital stakes that carry rights to receive 50% or more of
any distribution of capital of the foreign listed company;

as the case requires, are directly held by way of bearer
shares; and

(f) the beneficial owners of some or all of those bearer shares
have not been disclosed to the foreign listed company.

(2) The tests are applied to the tested company as if, at the * ownership
test time, for each of those bearer shares whose owners have not
been disclosed:

(a) a single notional entity controls, or is able to control, the
voting power in the tested company that is carried by those
shares at that time; and

(b) the entity * indirectly had the right to receive, for its own
benefit:

(i) any * dividends the tested company may pay in respect
of those shares at that time; and

(c) the entity were a person (other than a company).

Note: The persons who actually control the voting power and have rights to
dividends and capital are taken not to control that power or have those
rights: see section 166-265.

(3) To avoid doubt, the single notional entity mentioned in
subsection (2) is a different single notional entity from the one
mentioned in section 165-207 and the one mentioned in
section 166-225.

Note 1: See section 165-255 for the rule about incomplete test periods.

Note 2: This rule might not apply in all circumstances: see sections 166-275

whose owners have not been disclosed, the depository entity:

(a) controls, or is able to control, the voting power in the tested
company that is carried by those shares at that time; and

10% of any dividends that the tested company may pay; or

of any distribution of capital of the tested company;

then neither section 166-225 nor section 166-230 applies in respect
of that stake.

Note: Division 167 has special rules for working out rights to voting power,
dividends and capital distributions in a company whose shares do not

(i) the * tax loss; or

(ii) the * notional loss; or

(iii) the bad debt; or

(iv) the unrealised net loss (within the meaning of

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-5** Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions
**Division 166** Income tax consequences of changing ownership or control of a widely
held or eligible Division 166 company

##### Section 166-280

an alteration time is taken not to have occurred in respect of a
company, (as the case requires), if:

(a) a * tracing rule modifies how the ownership tests in
section 166-145 apply to the tested company in respect of a
* voting stake, a * dividend stake or a * capital stake; and

(b) the company fails the tests (whether at the time of applying
the tracing rule or at another time); and

(c) the company believes, on reasonable grounds, that if the
tracing rule did not modify how the tests apply to the
company in respect of that stake, it would not fail the tests.

Example: 11 people own shareholdings of 9% in the listed company. Under
section 166-225, one notional shareholder is deemed to hold all of
those shareholdings. 2 of the people sell their shareholdings so that 9
of the original 11 people now own shareholdings of 11%. Without the
rule in this section, the company would fail the ownership tests (as the
rule in section 166-225 no longer applies).

##### 166-280  Controlled test companies

(1) A * tracing rule does not modify how the ownership tests in
section 166-145 apply to the tested company in respect of all or
part of the voting power in the tested company, or all or some of
the rights to * dividends of, or capital in, the tested company, if:

(a) either:

(i) an entity (the **_controlling entity_** ) directly holds that
power or has those rights; or

(ii) an entity (the **_controlling entity_** ) indirectly holds that
power or has those rights through one or more
interposed entities; and

(b) the tested company is sufficiently influenced (within the
meaning of paragraph 318(6)(b) of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ ) by the controlling entity.

Note: However, a tracing rule can modify how the ownership tests in
section 166-145 apply to the tested company in respect of voting
power or dividend or capital rights held by entities other than
controlling entities.

##### Section 167-7

##### 167-7  Simplified outline of this Subdivision

If a condition of the continuity of ownership test cannot be worked
out for a company:

(a) because of its unequal share structure; or

(b) because of a holding company’s unequal share structure;

an entity can choose to reconsider that condition in up to 3 ways.

The first way involves disregarding debt interests.

The second way involves disregarding debt interests and secondary
share classes.

The third way involves disregarding those shares, and treating the
remaining shares as carrying certain percentages of the rights to
receive dividends and capital distributions.

The second way can only be tried after the first way, while the
third way can only be tried after the second way.

company if:

(a) despite section 167-15, the unsatisfied condition cannot be

(a) the company’s * shares do not all, at those times, carry the

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions **Part 3-5**

Treatment of certain company groups for income tax purposes **Division 170**

##### Section 170-10

Note: This Subdivision applies to Australian permanent establishments of
foreign entities that are financial entities in the same way as it applies
to Australian branches of foreign banks. See section 170-75.

(3) The transferred loss must be “surplus” in the sense that the
transferring company cannot use it because there is not enough
assessable income to offset it. The other company must have
enough assessable income to offset the transferred tax loss.

(4) Neither company must be prevented from deducting the loss by
Division 165 or 175.

Note: Division 165 deals with the income tax consequences of changing
ownership or control of a company. Division 175 deals with using a
company’s tax losses to avoid income tax.

(5) The tax loss is transferred by an agreement between the 2
companies.

(6) The tax loss can be transferred in the same year as it is incurred. In
that case different rules apply.

#### Effect of transferring a tax loss

##### 170-10  When a company can transfer a tax loss

(1) A company (the **_loss company_** ) can transfer an amount of its * tax
loss for an income year (the **_loss year_** ) to another company (the
**_income company_** ) if the conditions in this Subdivision are met.

(2) The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the * tax loss.

Note: A PDF cannot transfer a tax loss, except one for a period before it
became a PDF: see section 195-10.

##### 170-15  Income company is taken to have incurred transferred loss

(1) If an amount of a * tax loss is transferred, the amount is taken to be
a tax loss incurred by the * income company in the * loss year.

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-5** Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions
**Division 170** Treatment of certain company groups for income tax purposes

##### Section 170-20

(2) However, if the * loss year is the same as the income year of the
transfer, the * income company is taken to have incurred the * tax
loss in the income year before the loss year.

Note: This rule is needed because Division 36 allows a tax loss to be
deducted only if it was incurred in an _earlier_ income year.

(3) Despite subsection (1), if the * tax loss is transferred because the
conditions in section 170-32 are met, the * income company is
taken to have incurred the tax loss for the income year for which
the first prior transferor mentioned in that section incurred the tax
loss.

(4) Despite subsection (1), if the * tax loss is transferred because the
condition in subsection 170-42(4) is met, the * income company is
taken to have incurred the tax loss for the income year for which
that subsection assumes the income company incurred the tax loss.

##### 170-20  Who can deduct transferred loss

(1) If an amount of a * tax loss is transferred, the * income company can
deduct the amount in accordance with section 36-17 (which is
about how to deduct a tax loss), but only for the income year of the
income company for which the amount is transferred. That income
year is called the **_deduction year_** .

(2) The * loss company can no longer * utilise the transferred amount
and is taken not to have incurred the * tax loss to the extent of that
amount.

##### 170-25  Tax treatment of consideration for transferred tax loss

(1) If the * loss company receives any consideration from the * income
company for the amount of the * tax loss:

(a) so much of the consideration as is given for the amount of the
tax loss is neither assessable income nor exempt income of
the loss company; and

(b) a * capital gain does not accrue to the loss company because
of the receipt of the consideration.

_Circumstances_

(2) One circumstance is that there is another company (the **_first link_**
**_company_** ) in relation to which all these conditions are met:

(a) the first link company became a * subsidiary member of a
* consolidated group or * MEC group after the start of the * loss
year but before the time described in the item of the table in
subsection 170-30(4) that covers the * income company;

company were * in existence and members of the same
* wholly-owned group for the period:

(a) starting when the * tax loss would have been transferred under
Subdivision 707-A _to_ the other company as described in that
paragraph; and

(b) ending when the tax loss would have been transferred under
Subdivision 707-A _from_ the other company as described in
that paragraph.

(4) It does not matter whether or not any of the transfers mentioned in
subsection (3) would have involved the first link company or the
* income company as well as the other company.

(5) Another circumstance is that the conditions in
subsections 170-30(1) and (2) would have been met for the * loss
company and the * income company assuming:

(a) the * loss year consisted of the part of the income year in
which the * tax loss would have been transferred to the

##### Section 170-40

(a) under section 165-70 (because of a change in ownership or
control); or

(b) under section 175-35 (because of injected income or
deductions).

(3) Also, it must be the case that neither Subdivision 165-A nor
Subdivision 175-A would have prevented the * loss company from
deducting the * tax loss in the * deduction year if it had had enough
assessable income (including * assessable film income) to offset the
tax loss.

Note 1: Subdivision 165-A deals with the deductibility of a company’s tax
loss for an earlier income year if there has been a change in the
ownership or control of the company in the loss year or the income
year. Subdivision 175-A is about the Commissioner preventing a
company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused tax
losses.

Note 2: Division 707 affects the operation of Subdivision 165-A if the loss
company incurred the tax loss because of a transfer under
Subdivision 707-A.

##### 170-40  The income company

(1) The * income company must be an Australian resident and not a
* prescribed dual resident.

(2) It must not be prevented by Division 165 or 175 from deducting
the transferred amount in the * deduction year. Those Divisions do
not apply to the * income company if the * loss year and the
* deduction year are the same.

Note 1: Division 165 deals with the income tax consequences of changing
ownership or control of a company. Division 175 deals with using a
company’s tax losses to avoid income tax.

Note 2: The condition in subsection (2) may not apply in some cases. See
section 170-42.

##### Section 170-42

##### 170-42  If the income company has become the head company of a
##### consolidated group or MEC group

(1) The condition in subsection (2) of this section applies to the
* income company instead of the condition in subsection 170-40(2)
if the conditions in subsections 170-30(1) and (2) are met in
relation to the * loss company and the income company apart from
section 170-33 and either:

(a) both these circumstances exist:

(i) after the start of the * loss year but before the relevant
time described in subsection 170-30(4), the income
company became the * head company of a * consolidated
group or of a * MEC group that came into existence after
the start of the loss year;

(ii) the loss year and * deduction year are not the same; or

(b) all these circumstances exist:

(i) the income company is, at the relevant time described in
subsection 170-30(4), the head company of a MEC
group;

(ii) before that time but after the end of the loss year, the
MEC group was involved in an application event
described in section 719-300 (but not covered by
subsection 719-300(4) or (5));

(iii) the income company would be taken under
section 719-305 to have transferred losses to itself under
Subdivision 707-A, assuming it had made losses while
head company of the group or of a consolidated group
involved in the event;

(iv) the MEC group or consolidated group came into
existence before the start of the * loss year.

Note: An application event involves either expanding an existing MEC
group by including extra eligible tier-1 companies of the top company
for the group or creating a MEC group because more companies
become eligible tier-1 companies of the top company of which the
head company of a consolidated group is an eligible tier-1 company.

##### Section 170-45

(2) The * income company must have been able to deduct the * tax loss
in the * deduction year assuming that it had incurred the tax loss for
the * loss year.

(3) The condition in subsection (4) of this section applies to the
* income company instead of the condition in subsection 170-40(2)
if the conditions in subsections 170-30(1) and (2) are met in
relation to the * loss company and the income company because of
section 170-33.

(4) The * income company must have been able to deduct the * tax loss
in the * deduction year assuming that it had incurred the tax loss, for
the income year in which the loss would have been transferred to it
as described in paragraph 170-33(2)(c), because of one or more
transfers under Subdivision 707-A described in that paragraph.

##### 170-45  Maximum amount that can be transferred

_Loss company can only transfer what it cannot use itself_

(1) The amount transferred cannot exceed what would be the amount
of the * loss company’s * unutilised * tax loss at the end of the
* deduction year if the loss company utilised the tax loss to the
greatest extent possible.

_Transferred loss must not exceed what the income company can_
_use_

(2) The amount transferred also cannot exceed the amount worked out
as follows:

Step 2. Subtract the * income company’s deductions for the
* deduction year, except deductions for amounts of * tax
losses transferred to the income company (by the * loss
company or any other company).

Step 3. Subtract the * income company’s deductions for the
* deduction year for amounts of * tax losses transferred to
the income company (by the * loss company or any other
company) by agreements made _before_ the agreement by
which the first amount is transferred.

Example: In the deduction year:
- the income company has assessable income of $60,000, net
exempt income of $10,000 and deductions of $25,000 (apart
from the transferred loss); and

- another company, being a member of the same wholly-owned
group as the income company, transferred a tax loss of $15,000
to the income company; and

- the loss company incurred a tax loss of $50,000.

Of the $50,000 loss, the loss company can transfer no more than
$30,000 ($60,000+$10,000-$25,000-$15,000) to the income company.

(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if the * tax loss is a * film loss. In that
case, the amount transferred also cannot exceed the amount worked
out as follows:

_Method statement_

Step 1. Add together the * income company’s * net assessable film
income and * net exempt film income (if any) for the
* deduction year.

Step 2. Subtract the * income company’s deductions for the
* deduction year for amounts of * film losses transferred to
the income company (by the * loss company or any other
company) by agreements made _before_ the agreement by
which the first amount is transferred.

(4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the transfer occurs because

are met. In that case, the amount transferred also cannot exceed the
amount worked out as follows:

_Method statement_

Step 1. Identify each * bundle of losses that, on the assumption in
subsection 170-42(2) or (4) (as appropriate), would have
included the * tax loss or * film loss (as appropriate).

Note 1: There will be 2 or more bundles of losses identified if
both of the conditions in subsections 170-42(2) and (4)
are met.

Note 2: There will be more than 1 bundle of losses identified on
the basis of the assumption in paragraph 170-42(4) if the
conditions in subsections 170-30(1) and (2) are met in
relation to the loss company and the income company
because of multiple applications of section 170-33 each
involving a different first link company.

Step 2. For each * bundle identified, work out how much of the
* tax loss or * film loss (as appropriate) the * income
company would have been able to deduct in the
* deduction year assuming that:

(a) the loss could have been deducted in that year only
after the deduction in that year of any other losses
of that * sort that would have been included in the
bundle, other than losses (the **_transferable losses_** )
that could be transferred from the * loss company to
the income company for that year; and

(b) if the bundle would have included 2 or more
transferable losses of that sort—those losses could
have been deducted only in the order in which the
loss company incurred them.

Treatment of certain company groups for income tax purposes **Division 170**

##### Section 170-50

Note 1: If the assumption in subsection 170-42(2) is relevant to
the bundle, it would have included losses incurred by the
income company and transferred (or taken to be
transferred) to the company (from itself) under
Subdivision 707-A.

Note 2: If the assumption in paragraph 170-42(4) is relevant to
the bundle, it would have included losses actually
incurred by the first link company and transferred (by
one or more transfers under Subdivision 707-A) to the
income company.

Step 3. Total every result of step 2 for the * tax loss or * film loss
(as appropriate).

##### 170-50  Transfer by written agreement

(1) The transfer must be made by a written agreement **** between the
* loss company and the * income company.

(2) The agreement must:

(a) specify the income year of the transfer (which may be earlier
than the income year in which the agreement is made); and

(b) specify the amount of the * tax loss being transferred; and

(c) be signed by the public officer of each company; and

(d) be made on or before the day of lodgement of the * income
company’s * income tax return for the * deduction year, or
within such further time as the Commissioner allows.

Note: The agreement will usually be made in the next income year _after_ the
one for which the income company will deduct the loss.

##### 170-55  Losses must be transferred in order they are incurred

(1) If the * loss company has 2 or more * tax losses (other than * film
losses) that it can transfer in the * deduction year, it can transfer
them only in the order in which it incurred them.

(2) If the * loss company has 2 or more * film losses that it can transfer
in the * deduction year, it can transfer them only in the order in
which it incurred them.

(3) If:

(a) the * loss company has 2 or more * tax losses, or 2 or more
* film losses, it can transfer for the * deduction year; and

(b) it incurred at least one of those losses apart from
Subdivision 707-A and at least one of those losses because of
a transfer under that Subdivision;

it can transfer under this Subdivision the losses it incurred because
of a transfer under Subdivision 707-A only _after_ transferring under
this Subdivision the losses it incurred apart from that Subdivision.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), treat a loss incurred by the
company both apart from that Subdivision and because of a
transfer under that Subdivision as a loss incurred because of a
transfer under that Subdivision.

(5) Subsections (1) and (2) have effect subject to subsection (3).

##### 170-60  Income company cannot transfer transferred tax loss

The * income company cannot transfer an amount of a * tax loss
transferred to it, or any part of the amount.

#### Effect of agreement to transfer more than can be transferred

##### 170-65  Agreement transfers as much as can be transferred

(1) If the amount specified in an agreement exceeds the maximum
amount that the * loss company can transfer to the * income
company in the * deduction year, only that maximum amount is
taken to have been transferred.

(2) One reason why an agreement might specify more than can be
transferred is that an assessment has been amended since the
agreement.

##### 170-105  Basic principles for transferring a net capital loss

(1) A company can transfer a net capital loss (except a net capital loss
from collectables) to another company so that the other company
can apply it in working out its net capital gain for the income year
of the transfer.

(2) Both companies must be members of the same wholly-owned
group. There are other eligibility requirements that they must also
satisfy.

(2A) One of the companies must be an Australian branch of a foreign
bank. The other company must be:

(a) the head company of a consolidated group or MEC group; or

(b) _not_ a member of a consolidatable group.

Note: This Subdivision applies to Australian permanent establishments of
foreign entities that are financial entities in the same way as it applies
to Australian branches of foreign banks. See section 170-174.

(3) The transferred loss must be “surplus” in the sense that, for the
income year of the transfer, the transferring company does not
have enough capital gains against which to apply it. The other
company must have enough capital gains against which to apply it.

(5) Neither company must be prevented by Subdivision 165-CA or
175-CA from applying the loss in working out its net capital gain
for the income year of the transfer.

Note: Subdivision 165-CA deals with the consequences of changing
ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175-CA deals with
using a company’s net capital losses to avoid income tax.

**Division 170** Treatment of certain company groups for income tax purposes

##### Section 170-110

(6) The net capital loss is transferred by an agreement between the 2
companies.

(7) The net capital loss can be transferred in the same year as it is
made. In that case different rules apply.

(8) The provisions of Subdivision 170-C (so far as they relate to the
transfer of net capital losses) are to be disregarded in applying the
provisions of this Subdivision where the relevant agreement
referred to in section 170-150 was made before 22 February 1999.

#### Effect of transferring a net capital loss

##### 170-110  When a company can transfer a net capital loss

(1) A company (the **_loss company_** ) can transfer an amount of its * net
capital loss for an income year (the **_capital loss year_** ) to another
company (the **_gain company_** ) if the conditions in this Subdivision
are met.

(2) The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the * net capital
loss.

Note: A PDF cannot transfer a net capital loss, except one for a period
before it became a PDF: see section 195-30 of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1997_ .

##### 170-115  Who can apply transferred loss

(1) If an amount of a * net capital loss is transferred, the gain company
can apply the amount in working out its * net capital gain, but only
for the income year of the gain company for which the amount is
transferred. That income year is called the **_application year_** .

Note: A company’s net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is
usually worked out under section 102-5 or 102-10.

(2) The loss company can no longer * utilise the transferred amount and
is taken not to have made the * net capital loss to the extent of that
amount.

##### Section 170-120

(3) Despite subsection (1), if the * net capital loss is transferred because
the conditions in section 170-132 are met, the gain company is
taken to have made the net capital loss for the income year for
which the first prior transferor mentioned in that section made the
net capital loss.

(4) Despite subsection (1), if the * net capital loss is transferred because
the condition in subsection 170-142(4) is met, the gain company is
taken to have made the net capital loss for the income year for
which that subsection assumes the gain company made the net
capital loss.

##### 170-120  Gain company is taken to have made transferred loss

(1) If an amount of a * net capital loss is transferred, the amount is
taken to be a * net capital loss of the gain company for the capital
loss year.

(2) However, if the capital loss year is the same as the application
year, the amount is taken to be a * capital loss of the gain company
for the application year.

##### 170-125  Tax treatment of consideration for transferred tax loss 

(1) If the loss company receives consideration from the gain company
for the transferred amount:

(a) the consideration is neither assessable income nor * exempt
income of the loss company; and

(b) the loss company does not make a * capital gain because of
receiving the consideration.

Note: However, the consideration may affect how section 170-220 modifies
the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the loss company.

(2) If the gain company gives consideration to the loss company for
the transferred amount:

(a) the gain company cannot deduct the consideration; and

(b) the gain company does not make a * capital loss because of
giving the consideration.

_Circumstances_

(2) One circumstance is that there is another company (the **_first link_**
**_company_** ) in relation to which all these conditions are met:

(a) the first link company became a * subsidiary member of a
* consolidated group or * MEC group after the start of the

(3) Also, it must be the case that neither Subdivision 165-CA nor
Subdivision 175-CA would have prevented the loss company from
applying the * net capital loss in working out its * net capital gain for
the application year if it had made enough * capital gains in that

(b) all these circumstances exist:

(i) the gain company is, at the relevant time described in
subsection 170-130(4), the head company of a MEC
group;

(ii) before that time but after the end of the capital loss year,
the MEC group was involved in an application event
described in section 719-300 (but not covered by
subsection 719-300(4) or (5));

(iv) the MEC group or consolidated group came into
existence before the start of the capital loss year.

Note: An application event involves either expanding an existing MEC
group by including extra eligible tier-1 companies of the top company
for the group or creating a MEC group because more companies
become eligible tier-1 companies of the top company of which the
head company of a consolidated group is an eligible tier-1 company.

(2) The gain company must have been able to apply the * net capital
loss in working out its * net capital gain for the application year
assuming that it had made the net capital loss for the capital loss
year.

(3) The condition in subsection (4) of this section applies to the gain
company instead of the condition in subsection 170-140(2) if the
conditions in subsections 170-130(1) and (2) are met in relation to
the * loss company and the gain company because of
section 170-133.

$60,000 – $25,000 – $15,000 $20,000 

(7) Subsection (6) does not apply if the transfer occurs because either
or both of the conditions in subsections 170-142(2) and (4) are met.
In that case, the amount transferred also cannot exceed the amount
worked out as follows:

_Method statement_

Step 1. Identify each * bundle of losses that, on the assumption in
subsection 170-142(2) or (4) (as appropriate), would have
included the * net capital loss.

Note 1: There will be 2 or more bundles of losses identified if
both of the conditions in subsections 170-142(2) and (4)
are met.

Note 2: There will be more than 1 bundle of losses identified on
the basis of the assumption in paragraph 170-142(4) if
the conditions in subsections 170-130(1) and (2) are met
in relation to the loss company and the gain company
because of multiple applications of section 170-133 each
involving a different first link company.

Step 2. For each * bundle identified, work out how much of the
* net capital loss the gain company would have been able
to apply in working out its * net capital gain for the
application year assuming that:

##### Section 170-150

(a) the loss could have been applied in that year only
after the application in that year of any other losses
of that * sort that would have been included in the
bundle, other than losses (the **_transferable losses_** )
that could be transferred from the * loss company to
the gain company for that year; and

(b) if the bundle would have included 2 or more
transferable losses of that sort—those losses could
have been applied only in the order in which the
loss company made them.

Note 1: If the assumption in subsection 170-142(2) is relevant to
the bundle, it would have included losses made by the
gain company and transferred (or taken to be transferred)
to the company (from itself) under Subdivision 707-A.

Note 2: If the assumption in paragraph 170-142(4) is relevant to
the bundle, it would have included losses actually made
by the first link company and transferred (by one or
more transfers under Subdivision 707-A) to the gain
company.

Step 3. Total every result of step 2 for the * net capital loss.

##### 170-150  Transfer by written agreement

(1) The transfer must be made by a written agreement between the loss
company and the gain company.

(2) The agreement must:

(a) specify the income year of the transfer (which may be earlier
than the income year in which the agreement is made); and

(b) specify the amount of the * net capital loss being transferred;
and

(c) be signed by the public officer of each company; and

(d) be made on or before the day of lodgment of the gain
company’s * income tax return for the application year, or
within such further time as the Commissioner allows.

##### Section 170-155

Note: The agreement will usually be made in the next income year _after_ the
one for which the gain company will apply the loss.

##### 170-155  Losses must be transferred in order they are made

(1) If the loss company has 2 or more * net capital losses that it can
transfer in the application year, it can transfer them only in the
order in which it made them.

(2) If:

(a) the * loss company has 2 or more * net capital losses it can
transfer for the application year; and

(b) it made at least one of those losses apart from
Subdivision 707-A and at least one of those losses because of
a transfer under that Subdivision;

it can transfer under this Subdivision the losses it made because of
a transfer under Subdivision 707-A only _after_ transferring under
this Subdivision the losses it made apart from that Subdivision.

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), treat a loss made by the
company both apart from Subdivision 707-A and because of a
transfer under that Subdivision as a loss made because of a transfer
under that Subdivision.

(4) Subsection (1) has effect subject to subsection (2).

##### 170-160  Gain company cannot transfer transferred net capital loss

The gain company cannot transfer an amount of a * net capital loss
transferred to it, or any part of the amount.

#### Effect of agreement to transfer more than can be transferred

##### 170-165  Agreement transfers as much as can be transferred

(1) If the amount specified in an agreement exceeds the maximum
amount that the loss company can transfer to the gain company in
the application year, only that maximum amount is taken to have
been transferred.

##### Section 170-170

(2) One reason why an agreement might specify more than can be
transferred is that an assessment has been amended since the
agreement.

##### 170-170  Amendment of assessments

The Commissioner may amend an assessment to * disallow a
transferred amount of a * net capital loss:

(a) if the agreement to transfer the net capital loss is ineffective
because the loss company did not actually make the loss; or

(b) to the extent that section 170-165 reduces the transferred
amount because the loss company did not actually make
some of it.

The Commissioner may do so despite section 170 (Amendment of
assessments) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

of a CFC: see section 410 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

(1) The object of this section is to let * net capital losses be transferred
under this Subdivision to and from * Australian permanent
establishments of * foreign entities that are * financial entities in the
same way as net capital losses can be transferred to and from
Australian branches of * foreign banks.

(2) This Subdivision (except this section) applies to an * Australian
permanent establishment of a * foreign entity that is a * financial
entity in the same way as this Subdivision applies to an Australian
branch (as defined in Part IIIB of the _Income Tax Assessment Act_
_1936_ ) of a * foreign bank.

##### Section 170-205

#### Operative provisions

##### 170-205  Object of Subdivision

_Interests in the loss company_

(1) The main object of this Subdivision is to ensure that, if an amount
of a * tax loss or * net capital loss is transferred by a company to
another company in the same * wholly-owned group, the loss
transferred is not duplicated by a member of the group.

(2) Duplication could occur by the making of a * capital loss, or the
reduction of a * capital gain, from a * CGT event that happens in
relation to an equity interest held (directly or indirectly) in the loss
company or by the making of a capital loss in relation to a debt
interest held (directly or indirectly) in the loss company.

_Interests in the income company or gain company_

(3) This Subdivision may also require an adjustment to the cost base
and reduced cost base of an equity or debt interest held (directly or
indirectly) by a group company in the income company or gain
company.

(4) This adjustment is to reflect an increase in the * market value of the
interest because of the transfer of the loss if the increase is still
reflected in the market value of the interest when a * CGT event
happens in relation to the interest.

##### 170-210  Transfer of tax loss: direct and indirect interests in the loss
##### company

(1) If:

(a) an amount of a * tax loss is transferred by a company to
another company; and

(b) Subdivision 170-A applies in respect of the transfer; and

(e) the money that the group company paid for the share, or the
borrowed money, has been applied (directly, or indirectly
through one or more interposed entities):

(i) in the other company or a third company acquiring
shares in the loss company; or

(ii) in a * borrowing by the loss company from the other
company or from a third company; and

(f) throughout the deduction year, the group company, the other
company and the third company (if any) are all members of

not in existence); and

(g) a * CGT event happens in relation to the share or debt on or
after the commencement of this section; and

(h) the relevant agreement referred to in section 170-50 is made

the * cost base and * reduced cost base of the share or the reduced

(3) The * cost base and * reduced cost base of the share or the reduced
cost base of the debt is reduced by an amount that is appropriate
having regard to:

(aa) the main object of this Subdivision and other matters
mentioned in subsections 170-205(1) and (2); and

(a) the group company’s direct or indirect interest in the loss
company; and

(ba) any reduction in the reduced cost base made under
Subdivision 165-CD; and

(b) the amount of the loss transferred; and

(c) the extent to which the loss reduced the * market value of the

(d) any consideration received by the loss company for the loss
transferred; and

(e) whether, because of a dividend or dividends paid by the loss
company, the consideration is no longer reflected (wholly or
partly) in the market value of the share or debt when a * CGT
event happens in relation to it.

(3A) To avoid doubt in applying paragraph (3)(c) in relation to a * share
or debt, if factors other than the loss altered the * market value of
the share or debt, the extent to which the loss reduced that market
value is taken to be the extent to which that market value would
have been reduced apart from those other factors.

Note: An example of a factor other than the loss is the unrealised value of
assets (including assets in respect of which there is an unrealised gain)
of the loss company, whether or not generated by outlays or economic
losses reflected in the loss for income tax purposes.

* loss company.

Note: Where the income tax law allows, as all or part of a loss, an amount
for the decline in value of a depreciating asset that exceeds the actual

is not to be regarded for the purposes of this subsection as
representing an outlay or loss of economic resources of the company.

(4) Any reduction is to be made immediately before a * CGT event
happens in relation to the share or debt and is to have effect from
that time or the end of the deduction year, whichever is the earlier.

Note 1: For **_deduction year_** see subsection 170-20(1).

(ab) the amounts of any reductions to the cost base and reduced

(a) the group company’s direct or indirect interest in the income
company; and

(b) the amount of the loss transferred; and

(c) any consideration given by the income company for the loss
transferred.

Note: This is because the consideration may be less than the commercial
value of the loss transferred.

(4) However, the increase cannot exceed the increase in the * market
value of the * share or debt that results from the transfer of the loss.
(If no increase in that market value results, for example because the
consideration paid for the transfer of the loss equals the
commercial value of the loss transferred, then there is no increase
in the * cost base and * reduced cost base.)

does not represent an outlay or loss of any of the economic
resources of the company that transferred the tax loss.

Note: Where the income tax law allows, as all or part of a loss, an amount
for the decline in value of a depreciating asset that exceeds the actual
economic depreciation or depletion of the asset concerned, the excess
is not to be regarded for the purposes of this subsection as

##### Section 175-5

##### 175-5  When Commissioner can disallow deduction for tax loss

(1) This Subdivision sets out cases where the Commissioner may
disallow some or all of a * tax loss (or of part of a tax loss) (the
**_excluded loss_** ) as a deduction in calculating a company’s taxable
income of an income year after the * loss year.

(2) However, the Commissioner cannot disallow the * excluded loss if
the company:

(a) fails to meet a condition in section 165-12 (which is about
the company maintaining the same owners) in respect of the
* loss year or the income year; but

(b) meets the condition in section 165-13 in respect of the
income year by satisfying the * business continuity test under
section 165-210.

##### 175-10  First case: income or capital gain injected into company
##### because of available tax loss

(1) The Commissioner may disallow the * excluded loss if, during the
income year, the company * derived assessable income, or a * capital
gain accrued to the company, some or all of which (the **_injected_**
**_amount_** ) would not have been derived, or would not have accrued,
if the excluded loss had not been available to be taken into account
for the purposes of:

- Division 36 (which is about tax losses of earlier years);

- Division 165 (which is about the income tax consequences
of changing ownership or control of a company);

- former Subdivision 375-G (which is about film losses).

(2) However, the Commissioner cannot disallow the * excluded loss if
the * continuing shareholders will benefit from the derivation or
accrual of the * injected amount to an extent that the Commissioner
thinks fair and reasonable having regard to their respective rights
and interests in the company.

##### tax loss available to company

(1) The Commissioner may disallow the * excluded loss if:

(a) a person has obtained or will obtain a tax benefit in
connection with a * scheme; and

##### 175-40  When Commissioner can disallow net capital loss of earlier
##### income year

(1) This Subdivision sets out cases where the Commissioner may
prevent a company, in working out its * net capital gain for an
income year, from applying some or all of a * net capital loss it has
for an earlier income year (or of part of one) (the **_excluded_**  **_loss_** ).
This is called **_disallowing_** the excluded loss.

Note: A company’s net capital gain for an income year is usually worked out
under section 102-5.

(2) However, the Commissioner cannot * disallow the * excluded loss if,
in determining (under section 165-96) whether Subdivision 165-A
would prevent the company from deducting the loss (or the part of
the loss) for the income year if the loss were a * tax loss of the
company for that earlier income year, the company:

(a) would fail to meet a condition in section 165-12 (which is
about the company maintaining the same owners) in respect
of the income year; but

(b) would meet the condition in section 165-13 in respect of the
income year by satisfying the * business continuity test under
section 165-210.

Note: Subdivision 165-A deals with the deductibility of a company’s tax
loss for an earlier income year if there has been a change in the
ownership or control of the company in the period from the start of the
loss year to the end of the income year.

company’s capital distributions during the whole (or the
relevant part) of the earlier income year and during the whole
of the income year.

To find out who they were, apply whichever tests are applied in

Subdivision 165-A would prevent the company from deducting the
loss for the current year if it were a * tax loss of the company for

#### Working out a PDF’s taxable income and tax loss

##### 195-5  Deductibility of PDF tax losses

If a company is a * PDF at the end of an income year for which it

if it is a PDF throughout the later income year.

##### 195-10  PDF cannot transfer tax loss

If a company is a * PDF at the end of an income year for which it

##### 195-15  Tax loss for year in which company becomes a PDF

(1) This section applies if a company becomes a * PDF during an

income year and ending when the company becomes a * PDF;

(b) the **_PDF period_** is the rest of the income year.

(3) For each period, work out whether the company has a taxable
income or a * tax loss (or both), treating each period as if it were an
income year.

(4) If the company has:

(a) a taxable income for the non-PDF period; and

(b) a * tax loss for the PDF period;

that tax loss is a tax loss of the company for the income year.

Note: The company can only deduct the tax loss while it is a PDF: see
section 195-5.

#### Subdivision 195-C—Corporate collective investment vehicles

#### Guide to Subdivision 195-C

##### 195-100  What this Subdivision is about

The business, assets and liabilities of each sub-fund of a CCIV are
taken to constitute the trust estate of a separate trust (a CCIV
sub-fund trust), of which the CCIV is the trustee and the members
of the sub-fund are the beneficiaries.

This Subdivision sets out further rules to facilitate the CCIV, and
the sub-fund and its members, being taxed on this basis, including:

- modifications of the rules for determining whether the CCIV
sub-fund trust is a managed investment trust (under
Division 275) and an attribution managed investment trust
(under Division 276); and

Note: These modifications also affect whether the trust is a withholding
MIT under Subdivision 12-H in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation_
_Administration Act 1953_ .

- rules to support the application of Division 6 or 6C of Part III
of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ , to the extent that
Division applies to the trust; and

- rules to support the application to the trust of relevant rules
about trust losses and capital gains.

#### Operative provisions

##### 195-105  Effect of this Subdivision

(1) This Subdivision has effect for the purposes of all * taxation laws,
to the exclusion of those laws as they would otherwise apply in
relation to * CCIVs and their members (in their capacity as such).

Note: Subsection (3) excludes some taxation laws from this subsection.

(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the purposes
referred to in that subsection include how * taxation laws apply in
relation to other entities, in so far as that application is affected by
the application of those laws in relation to * CCIVs and their
members (in their capacity as such).

Note: For example, in applying subsection 318(1) of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ to determine whether a CCIV is an associate of a
natural person for the purposes of a provision affecting the income tax
payable by that person:
(a) paragraph 318(1)(d) of that Act (providing for when a trustee of
a trust is an associate of the natural person) would apply; and

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions **Part 3-5**

Special types of company **Division 195**

##### Section 195-110

(b) paragraph 318(1)(e) of that Act (providing for when a company
is an associate of the natural person) would not apply.

(3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to the following * taxation
laws:

(a) the _Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975_ ;

(b) legislative instruments made under that Act.

##### 195-110  Each sub-fund of a CCIV is taken to be a separate trust

(1) For each * sub-fund of a * CCIV, the business, * assets and * liabilities
of the sub-fund are taken to constitute the trust estate of a separate
trust, of which the CCIV is the trustee and the * members of the
sub-fund are the beneficiaries.

(2) A trust that is taken to exist because of the application of
subsection (1) to a * sub-fund of a * CCIV is a **_CCIV sub-fund trust_** .

Note: The combined effect of this section and subsections 960-100(2) and
(3) is that a CCIV is a different entity in its capacity as trustee of each
of its CCIV sub-fund trusts.

Because of subsection 195-105(1), the tax treatment of the CCIV in
those capacities excludes the tax treatment that would otherwise apply
to the CCIV as a company. Also, the tax treatment of members of the
CCIV is based on them being treated as beneficiaries of their
respective CCIV sub-fund trusts, to the exclusion of the tax treatment
that would otherwise apply to them as members of a company.

Example 1: CCIV A has only one sub-fund (sub-fund A). CCIV B has only one
sub-fund (sub-fund B).

CCIV A holds shares in CCIV B. The shares are referable to sub-fund
B. They are assets of sub-fund A.

In its capacity as trustee of the CCIV sub-fund trust for sub-fund A,
CCIV A is a beneficiary of the CCIV sub-fund trust for sub-fund B.

Example 2:A CCIV has 2 sub-funds: sub-fund A and sub-fund B.

As permitted by section 1230Q of the _Corporations Act 2001_ , the
CCIV acquires, in respect of sub-fund A, shares that are referable to
sub-fund B. The shares are assets of sub-fund A.

In its capacity as trustee of the CCIV sub-fund trust for sub-fund A,
the CCIV is a beneficiary of the CCIV sub-fund trust for sub-fund B.

##### Section 195-115

##### 195-115  A CCIV sub-fund trust is a unit trust

(1) A * CCIV sub-fund trust is taken to be a unit trust.

Note: One consequence of this subsection is that a CCIV sub-fund trust can
be a public unit trust if it meets the other tests in section 102P of the
_Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

(2) The * shares that are * referable to the * sub-fund are taken to be the
units in the trust.

(3) The rights, obligations and other characteristics attaching to a unit
in the trust are taken to be the same, as nearly as practicable, as the
rights, obligations and other characteristics attaching to the share
that is taken to be that unit.

Note: One consequence of this section is that if shares that are referable to
the sub-fund are listed for quotation in the official list of a stock
exchange, the units in the sub-fund trust that those shares are taken to
be will likewise be taken to be listed in that official list.

Examples of provisions to which this is relevant are:
(a) paragraph 275-20(2)(a) (widely-held requirement for managed
investment trusts) of this Act; and

(b) paragraph 102P(1)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ 
(public unit trusts).

##### 195-120  Beneficiary of a CCIV sub-fund trust has fixed entitlements
##### to shares of income and capital of the trust

(1) A * beneficiary of a * CCIV sub-fund trust is taken to have a **_fixed_**
**_entitlement_** to a share of income of the trust that the trust derives
from time to time. At a particular time, that share is equal to the
percentage worked out using the formula:

Beneficiary dividends
100
Total dividends


where:

**_beneficiary dividends_** is the total of the * dividends that the
* beneficiary has a right to receive because of * shares that the
beneficiary holds at that time and are * referable to the * sub-fund.

##### Section 195-123

**_total dividends_** is the total of all * dividends that are payable on all
* shares that are on issue at that time and are * referable to the
* sub-fund.

(2) A * beneficiary of a * CCIV sub-fund trust is taken to have a **_fixed_**
**_entitlement_** to a share of the capital of the trust at a particular time
equal to the percentage worked out using the formula:

Beneficiary capital distribution
100
Total capital distribution


where:

**_beneficiary capital distribution_** is the amount of a distribution of
paid-up capital (in the event of a return of capital) that the
* beneficiary has a right to receive because of * shares that the
beneficiary holds at that time and are * referable to the * sub-fund.

**_total capital distribution_** is the total distribution of paid-up capital
(in that event) payable on all * shares that are on issue at that time
and are * referable to the * sub-fund.

(3) A fixed entitlement that exists because of this section is taken to be
a fixed entitlement within the meaning given by sections 272-5,
272-10, 272-15 and 272-40 in Schedule 2F to the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ .

Note: This is relevant to, for example, the definition of **_fixed entitlement_** in
subsection 102UC(4) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

##### 195-123  How to work out the income of the trust estate of a CCIV
##### sub-fund trust for an income year

(1) The income (the **_trust income_** ) of the trust estate of a * CCIV
sub-fund trust for an income year is worked out in accordance with
this section.

Note: This is relevant to working out the income tax position of the CCIV
sub-fund trust and its beneficiaries under Division 6 of Part III of the
_Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

(b) the amount of the * sub-fund’s profit for the income year, as
required to be stated in the financial statements included in
the financial report for the sub-fund for the income year that
the CCIV is required to prepare because of

the trust income is that profit.

(4) If neither of subsections (2) and (3) applies, the trust income is nil.

##### 195-125  When a beneficiary of a CCIV sub-fund trust is presently
##### entitled to trust income

(1) A * beneficiary of a * CCIV sub-fund trust is taken to be presently
entitled to a share of the income of the trust estate for an income
year if any of the * sub-fund’s profit for the income year was or is
payable to the beneficiary by way of one or more * dividends
declared during, or within 3 months after, the income year.

(2) That share consists of so much of that profit as was or is payable to
the beneficiary by way of one or more such * dividends.

Note: To the extent that any of that profit is not payable to a beneficiary by
way of such dividends, it will be income to which no beneficiary is
presently entitled. This can have consequences under section 99 or
99A of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

##### Section 197-50

**_applicable gross-up rate_** means the company’s * corporate tax
gross-up rate for the income year in which the franking debit
arises.

#### Subdivision 197-C—Consequence of transfer: tainting of share
#### capital account

197-50 The share capital account becomes tainted (if it is not already tainted)

197-55 Choosing to untaint a tainted share capital account

197-60 Choosing to untaint—liability to untainting tax

197-65 Choosing to untaint—further franking debits may arise

197-70 Due date for payment of untainting tax

197-75 General interest charge for late payment of untainting tax

197-80 Notice of liability to pay untainting tax

197-85 Evidentiary effect of notice of liability to pay untainting tax

##### 197-50  The share capital account becomes tainted (if it is not already
##### tainted)

(1) A company’s * share capital account becomes **_tainted_** when an
amount to which this Division applies is transferred to the account,
if, at the time of the transfer, the account is not already tainted
(because of the application of this section in relation to a previous
transfer).

Note: If a company’s share capital account is tainted, then a distribution
from the account is taxed as a dividend in the hands of the
shareholder. This is because a tainted share capital account does not
count as a share capital account for the purposes of paragraph (d) of
the definition of **_dividend_** in subsection 6(1) of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ (see subsection 975-300(3) of this Act).
However, although the distribution is taxed as a dividend, the
company cannot pass on to the shareholder the benefit of the tax it has
paid, because a distribution from a share capital account (whether or
not tainted) is unfrankable (see paragraphs 202-45(e) and
975-300(3)(ba) of this Act).

(2) The * share capital account remains **_tainted_** until the company
chooses to untaint the account (see section 197-55).

##### Section 197-65

##### 197-65  Choosing to untaint—further franking debits may arise

_When this section applies_

(1) This section applies if:

(a) a company chooses to untaint its * share capital account; and

(b) the applicable franking percentage (within the meaning of
subsection (3)) is higher than the percentage that was the
* benchmark franking percentage in relation to the * franking
period in which the transfer of an amount (the **_transferred_**
**_amount_** ) that is, or is part of, the * tainting amount occurred.

Note: If paragraph (b) is satisfied in relation to 2 or more amounts, this
section is to be applied separately in relation to each of those amounts
(so a separate franking debit will arise in relation to each of those
amounts).

_Franking debit arises in relation to making the choice_

(2) A * franking debit arises in the company’s * franking account in
relation to the transferred amount. The debit arises immediately
before the end of the * franking period in which the choice to
untaint is made.

(3) The amount of the * franking debit is the amount by which the
amount calculated in accordance with the following formula
exceeds the amount of the franking debit that arose under
section 197-45 in relation to the transferred amount:

Applicable franking percentage
Transferred amount
Applicable gross-up rate


where:

**_applicable franking percentage_** means:

(a) if, before the debit arises, the * benchmark franking
percentage for the * franking period in which the choice to
untaint is made has already been set by section 203-30—that
percentage; or

(b) otherwise—100%.
