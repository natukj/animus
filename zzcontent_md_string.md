**P** **ART** **4**

A COMPANY ’ S  CAPACITY  AND  RELATED  MATTERS

_Capacity of company and power of directors to bind it_

**39** **A company’s capacity**

(1) The validity of an act done by a company shall not be called into question on
the ground of lack of capacity by reason of anything in the company’s
constitution.

(2) This section has effect subject to section 42 (companies that are charities).

**40** **Power of directors to bind the company**

(1) In favour of a person dealing with a company in good faith, the power of the
directors to bind the company, or authorise others to do so, is deemed to be free
of any limitation under the company’s constitution.

(2) For this purpose—
(a) a person “deals with” a company if he is a party to any transaction or
other act to which the company is a party,
(b) a person dealing with a company—
(i) is not bound to enquire as to any limitation on the powers of the
directors to bind the company or authorise others to do so,
(ii) is presumed to have acted in good faith unless the contrary is
proved, and
(iii) is not to be regarded as acting in bad faith by reason only of his
knowing that an act is beyond the powers of the directors under
the company’s constitution.

(3) The references above to limitations on the directors’ powers under the
company’s constitution include limitations deriving—
(a) from a resolution of the company or of any class of shareholders, or
(b) from any agreement between the members of the company or of any
class of shareholders.

(4) This section does not affect any right of a member of the company to bring
proceedings to restrain the doing of an action that is beyond the powers of the
directors.
But no such proceedings lie in respect of an act to be done in fulfilment of a
legal obligation arising from a previous act of the company.

(5) This section does not affect any liability incurred by the directors, or any other
person, by reason of the directors’ exceeding their powers.

(6) This section has effect subject to—
section 41 (transactions with directors or their associates), and
section 42 (companies that are charities).

_Part 4 — A company’s capacity and related matters_
17

**41** **Constitutional limitations: transactions involving directors or their associates**

(1) This section applies to a transaction if or to the extent that its validity depends
on section 40 (power of directors deemed to be free of limitations under
company’s constitution in favour of person dealing with company in good
faith).
Nothing in this section shall be read as excluding the operation of any other
enactment or rule of law by virtue of which the transaction may be called in
question or any liability to the company may arise.

(2) Where—
(a) a company enters into such a transaction, and
(b) the parties to the transaction include—
(i) a director of the company or of its holding company, or
(ii) a person connected with any such director,
the transaction is voidable at the instance of the company.

(3) Whether or not it is avoided, any such party to the transaction as is mentioned
in subsection (2)(b)(i) or (ii), and any director of the company who authorised
the transaction, is liable—
(a) to account to the company for any gain he has made directly or
indirectly by the transaction, and
(b) to indemnify the company for any loss or damage resulting from the
transaction.

(4) The transaction ceases to be voidable if—
(a) restitution of any money or other asset which was the subject matter of
the transaction is no longer possible, or
(b) the company is indemnified for any loss or damage resulting from the
transaction, or
(c) rights acquired bona fide for value and without actual notice of the
directors’ exceeding their powers by a person who is not party to the
transaction would be affected by the avoidance, or
(d) the transaction is affirmed by the company.

(5) A person other than a director of the company is not liable under subsection (3)
if he shows that at the time the transaction was entered into he did not know
that the directors were exceeding their powers.

(6) Nothing in the preceding provisions of this section affects the rights of any
party to the transaction not within subsection (2)(b)(i) or (ii).
But the court may, on the application of the company or any such party, make
an order affirming, severing or setting aside the transaction on such terms as
appear to the court to be just.

(7) In this section—
(a) “transaction” includes any act; and
(b) the reference to a person connected with a director has the same
meaning as in Part 10 (company directors).

**42** **Constitutional limitations: companies that are charities**

(1) Sections 39 and 40 (company’s capacity and power of directors to bind
company) do not apply to the acts of a company that is a charity except in
favour of a person who—

18

(a) does not know at the time the act is done that the company is a charity,
or
(b) gives full consideration in money or money’s worth in relation to the
act in question and does not know (as the case may be)—
(i) that the act is not permitted by the company’s constitution, or
(ii) that the act is beyond the powers of the directors.

(2) Where a company that is a charity purports to transfer or grant an interest in
property, the fact that (as the case may be)—
(a) the act was not permitted by the company’s constitution, or
(b) the directors in connection with the act exceeded any limitation on their
powers under the company’s constitution,
does not affect the title of a person who subsequently acquires the property or
any interest in it for full consideration without actual notice of any such
circumstances affecting the validity of the company’s act.

(3) In any proceedings arising out of subsection (1) or (2) the burden of proving—
(a) that a person knew that the company was a charity, or
(b) that a person knew that an act was not permitted by the company’s
constitution or was beyond the powers of the directors,
lies on the person asserting that fact.

(4) In the case of a company that is a charity the affirmation of a transaction to
which section 41 applies (transactions with directors or their associates) is
ineffective without the prior written consent of—
(a) in England and Wales, the Charity Commission;
(b) in Northern Ireland, the Department for Social Development.

(c) an application for re-registration is delivered to the registrar in
accordance with section 94, together with—
(i) the other documents required by that section, and

(2) The conditions are—
(a) that the company has a share capital;
(b) that the requirements of section 91 are met as regards its share capital;
(c) that the requirements of section 92 are met as regards its net assets;
(d) if section 93 applies (recent allotment of shares for non-cash
consideration), that the requirements of that section are met; and
(e) that the company has not previously been re-registered as unlimited.

(3) The company must make such changes—
(a) in its name, and
(b) in its articles,
as are necessary in connection with its becoming a public company.

(4) If the company is unlimited it must also make such changes in its articles as are
necessary in connection with its becoming a company limited by shares.

**91** **Requirements as to share capital**

(1) The following requirements must be met at the time the special resolution is
passed that the company should be re-registered as a public company—
(a) the nominal value of the company’s allotted share capital must be not
less than the authorised minimum;
(b) each of the company’s allotted shares must be paid up at least as to one-
quarter of the nominal value of that share and the whole of any
premium on it;
(c) if any shares in the company or any premium on them have been fully
or partly paid up by an undertaking given by any person that he or
another should do work or perform services (whether for the company
or any other person), the undertaking must have been performed or
otherwise discharged;
(d) if shares have been allotted as fully or partly paid up as to their nominal
value or any premium on them otherwise than in cash, and the

_Part 7 — Re-registration as a means of altering a company’s status_
40

consideration for the allotment consists of or includes an undertaking
to the company (other than one to which paragraph (c) applies), then
either—
(i) the undertaking must have been performed or otherwise
discharged, or
(ii) there must be a contract between the company and some person
pursuant to which the undertaking is to be performed within
five years from the time the special resolution is passed.

(2) For the purpose of determining whether the requirements in subsection (1)(b),
(c) and (d) are met, the following may be disregarded—
(a) shares allotted—
(i) before 22nd June 1982 in the case of a company then registered
in Great Britain, or
(ii) before 31st December 1984 in the case of a company then
registered in Northern Ireland;
(b) shares allotted in pursuance of an employees’ share scheme by reason
of which the company would, but for this subsection, be precluded
under subsection (1)(b) (but not otherwise) from being re-registered as
a public company.

(3) No more than one-tenth of the nominal value of the company’s allotted share
capital is to be disregarded under subsection (2)(a).
For this purpose the allotted share capital is treated as not including shares
disregarded under subsection (2)(b).

(4) Shares disregarded under subsection (2) are treated as not forming part of the
allotted share capital for the purposes of subsection (1)(a).

(5) A company must not be re-registered as a public company if it appears to the
registrar that—
(a) the company has resolved to reduce its share capital,
(b) the reduction—
(i) is made under section 626 (reduction in connection with
redenomination of share capital),
(ii) is supported by a solvency statement in accordance with section
643, or
(iii) has been confirmed by an order of the court under section 648,
and
(c) the effect of the reduction is, or will be, that the nominal value of the
company’s allotted share capital is below the authorised minimum.

**92** **Requirements as to net assets**

(1) A company applying to re-register as a public company must obtain—
(a) a balance sheet prepared as at a date not more than seven months
before the date on which the application is delivered to the registrar,
(b) an unqualified report by the company’s auditor on that balance sheet,
and
(c) a written statement by the company’s auditor that in his opinion at the
balance sheet date the amount of the company’s net assets was not less
than the aggregate of its called-up share capital and undistributable
reserves.



-----


_Companies Act 2006 (c._ **_46_** _)_
_Part 7 — Re-registration as a means of altering a company’s status_
41

(2) Between the balance sheet date and the date on which the application for re-
registration is delivered to the registrar, there must be no change in the
company’s financial position that results in the amount of its net assets
becoming less than the aggregate of its called-up share capital and
undistributable reserves.

(3) In subsection (1)(b) an “unqualified report” means—
(a) if the balance sheet was prepared for a financial year of the company, a
report stating without material qualification the auditor’s opinion that
the balance sheet has been properly prepared in accordance with the
requirements of this Act;
(b) if the balance sheet was not prepared for a financial year of the
company, a report stating without material qualification the auditor’s
opinion that the balance sheet has been properly prepared in
accordance with the provisions of this Act which would have applied
if it had been prepared for a financial year of the company.

(4) For the purposes of an auditor’s report on a balance sheet that was not
prepared for a financial year of the company, the provisions of this Act apply
with such modifications as are necessary by reason of that fact.

(5) For the purposes of subsection (3) a qualification is material unless the auditor
states in his report that the matter giving rise to the qualification is not material
for the purpose of determining (by reference to the company’s balance sheet)
whether at the balance sheet date the amount of the company’s net assets was
not less than the aggregate of its called-up share capital and undistributable
reserves.

(6) In this Part “net assets” and “undistributable reserves” have the same meaning
as in section 831 (net asset restriction on distributions by public companies).

**93** **Recent allotment of shares for non-cash consideration**

(1) This section applies where—
(a) shares are allotted by the company in the period between the date as at
which the balance sheet required by section 92 is prepared and the
passing of the resolution that the company should re-register as a
public company, and
(b) the shares are allotted as fully or partly paid up as to their nominal
value or any premium on them otherwise than in cash.

(2) The registrar shall not entertain an application by the company for re-
registration as a public company unless—
(a) the requirements of section 593(1)(a) and (b) have been complied with
(independent valuation of non-cash consideration; valuer’s report to
company not more than six months before allotment), or
(b) the allotment is in connection with—
(i) a share exchange (see subsections (3) to (5) below), or
(ii) a proposed merger with another company (see subsection (6)
below).

(3) An allotment is in connection with a share exchange if—
(a) the shares are allotted in connection with an arrangement under which
the whole or part of the consideration for the shares allotted is provided
by—



-----

(i) the transfer to the company allotting the shares of shares (or
shares of a particular class) in another company, or
(ii) the cancellation of shares (or shares of a particular class) in
another company; and
(b) the allotment is open to all the holders of the shares of the other
company in question (or, where the arrangement applies only to shares
of a particular class, to all the holders of the company’s shares of that
class) to take part in the arrangement in connection with which the
shares are allotted.

(4) In determining whether a person is a holder of shares for the purposes of
subsection (3), there shall be disregarded—
(a) shares held by, or by a nominee of, the company allotting the shares;
(b) shares held by, or by a nominee of—
(i) the holding company of the company allotting the shares,
(ii) a subsidiary of the company allotting the shares, or
(iii) a subsidiary of the holding company of the company allotting
the shares.

(5) It is immaterial, for the purposes of deciding whether an allotment is in
connection with a share exchange, whether or not the arrangement in
connection with which the shares are allotted involves the issue to the
company allotting the shares of shares (or shares of a particular class) in the
other company.

(6) There is a proposed merger with another company if one of the companies
concerned proposes to acquire all the assets and liabilities of the other in
exchange for the issue of its shares or other securities to shareholders of the
other (whether or not accompanied by a cash payment).
“Another company” includes any body corporate.

(7) For the purposes of this section—
(a) the consideration for an allotment does not include any amount
standing to the credit of any of the company’s reserve accounts, or of its
profit and loss account, that has been applied in paying up (to any
extent) any of the shares allotted or any premium on those shares; and
(b) “arrangement” means any agreement, scheme or arrangement,
(including an arrangement sanctioned in accordance with—
(i) Part 26 of this Act (arrangements and reconstructions), or
(ii) section 110 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45) or Article 96 of the
Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (S.I. 1989/2405 (N.I.

director is to retire, as if he had become director on the day on which the person
in whose place he is appointed was last appointed a director.

(a) as depriving a person removed under it of compensation or damages
payable to him in respect of the termination of his appointment as
director or of any appointment terminating with that as director, or

from this section.

the fact of the representations having been made; and

(4) If a copy of the representations is not sent as required by subsection (3) because
received too late or because of the company's default, the director may
(without prejudice to his right to be heard orally) require that the
representations shall be read out at the meeting.

(5) Copies of the representations need not be sent out and the representations need
not be read out at the meeting if, on the application either of the company or of
any other person who claims to be aggrieved, the court is satisfied that the
rights conferred by this section are being abused.

(6) The court may order the company's costs (in Scotland, expenses) on an
application under subsection (5) to be paid in whole or in part by the director,
notwithstanding that he is not a party to the application.

member, one qualifying person present at a meeting is a quorum.

(2) In any other case, subject to the provisions of the company’s articles, two
qualifying persons present at a meeting are a quorum, unless—
(a) each is a qualifying person only because he is authorised under section
323 to act as the representative of a corporation in relation to the
meeting, and they are representatives of the same corporation; or
(b) each is a qualifying person only because he is appointed as proxy of a
member in relation to the meeting, and they are proxies of the same
member.

(3) For the purposes of this section a “qualifying person” means—
(a) an individual who is a member of the company,
(b) a person authorised under section 323 (representation of corporations
at meetings) to act as the representative of a corporation in relation to
the meeting, or
(c) a person appointed as proxy of a member in relation to the meeting.

(1) On a vote on a resolution at a meeting on a show of hands, a declaration by the
chairman that the resolution—

(b) passed with a particular majority,
is conclusive evidence of that fact without proof of the number or proportion
of the votes recorded in favour of or against the resolution.

(2) An entry in respect of such a declaration in minutes of the meeting recorded in
accordance with section 355 is also conclusive evidence of that fact without
such proof.

(3) This section does not have effect if a poll is demanded in respect of the
resolution (and the demand is not subsequently withdrawn).

**321** **Right to demand a poll**

voting rights of all the members having the right to vote on the
resolution (excluding any voting rights attached to any shares in the
company held as treasury shares); or
(c) by a member or members holding shares in the company conferring a
right to vote on the resolution, being shares on which an aggregate sum
has been paid up equal to not less than 10% of the total sum paid up on

conferring a right to vote on the resolution which are held as treasury
shares).

On a poll taken at a general meeting of a company, a member entitled to more
than one vote need not, if he votes, use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses
in the same way.

**323** **Representation of corporations at meetings**

(1) If a corporation (whether or not a company within the meaning of this Act) is
a member of a company, it may by resolution of its directors or other governing
body authorise a person or persons to act as its representative or
representatives at any meeting of the company.

(2) Where the corporation authorises only one person, he is entitled to exercise the
same powers on behalf of the corporation as the corporation could exercise if
it were an individual member of the company.

(3) Where the corporation authorises more than one person, any one of them is
entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation as the
corporation could exercise if it were an individual member of the company.

(4) Where the corporation authorises more than one person and more than one of
them purport to exercise a power under subsection (3)—
(a) if they purport to exercise the power in the same way, the power is

(3) Where a contract for the allotment of shares does not contravene subsection (1),
any variation of the contract that has the effect that the contract would have
contravened the subsection, if the terms of the contract as varied had been its
original terms, is void.
This applies also to the variation by a public company of the terms of a contract
entered into before the company was re-registered as a public company.

includes (in accordance with subsection (1)) an undertaking that is to be

contract for the allotment of the shares,
the allottee is liable to pay the company, at the end of the period so allowed, an
amount equal to the aggregate of the nominal value of the shares and the whole
of any premium (or, if the case so requires, so much of that aggregate as is
treated as paid up by the undertaking), with interest at the appropriate rate.

(5) References in this section to a contract for the allotment of shares include an
ancillary contract relating to payment in respect of them.

under the provision contravened,
that person is also liable to pay that amount (jointly and severally with any

became a holder of them after the contravention and was not liable
under subsection (1).

provision of this Chapter or Chapter 6, or
(ii) any liability arising by virtue of any undertaking given in or in

amount.

(5) In determining whether it should exempt the applicant in whole or in part from
any liability, the court must have regard to the following overriding
principles—
(a) a company that has allotted shares should receive money or money’s
worth at least equal in value to the aggregate of the nominal value of
those shares and the whole of any premium or, if the case so requires,
so much of that aggregate as is treated as paid up;
(b) subject to that, where a company would, if the court did not grant the
exemption, have more than one remedy against a particular person, it
should be for the company to decide which remedy it should remain
entitled to pursue.

(6) If a person brings proceedings against another (“the contributor”) for a
contribution in respect of liability to a company arising under any provision of
this Chapter or Chapter 6 and it appears to the court that the contributor is
liable to make such a contribution, the court may, if and to the extent that it
appears to it just and equitable to do so having regard to the respective
culpability (in respect of the liability to the company) of the contributor and the
person bringing the proceedings—
(a) exempt the contributor in whole or in part from his liability to make
such a contribution, or

accordance with the provisions of this Chapter,
(b) the valuer’s report has been made to the company during the six
months immediately preceding the allotment of the shares, and

(a) any of a company’s reserve accounts, or

(3) If a company allots shares in contravention of subsection (1) and either—
(a) the allottee has not received the valuer’s report required to be sent to

in another company (“company B”).

(3) It is immaterial whether the arrangement provides for the issue to company A
of shares, or shares of any particular class, in company B.

(4) This section applies to an arrangement only if under the arrangement it is open
to all the holders of the shares in company B (or, where the arrangement
applies only to shares of a particular class, to all the holders of shares of that
class) to take part in the arrangement.

(5) In determining whether that is the case, the following shall be disregarded—
(a) shares held by or by a nominee of company A;
(b) shares held by or by a nominee of a company which is—
(i) the holding company, or a subsidiary, of company A, or
(ii) a subsidiary of such a holding company;
(c) shares held as treasury shares by company B.

(6) In this section—
(a) “arrangement” means any agreement, scheme or arrangement
(including an arrangement sanctioned in accordance with—
(i) Part 26 (arrangements and reconstructions), or
(ii) section 110 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45) or Article 96 of the
Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (S.I. 1989/2405

body corporate.

(a) the nominal value of the shares to be wholly or partly paid for by the
consideration in question;

consideration as he himself has valued, a description of that part of the
consideration, the method used to value it and the date of the valuation;
(d) the extent to which the nominal value of the shares and any premium
are to be treated as paid up—
(i) by the consideration;
(ii) in cash.

(3) The valuer’s report must contain or be accompanied by a note by him—
(a) in the case of a valuation made by a person other than himself, that it
appeared to himself reasonable to arrange for it to be so made or to

reasonable in all the circumstances,
(c) that it appears to the valuer that there has been no material change in
the value of the consideration in question since the valuation, and
(d) that, on the basis of the valuation, the value of the consideration,
together with any cash by which the nominal value of the shares or any
premium payable on them is to be paid up, is not less than so much of
the aggregate of the nominal value and the whole of any such premium
as is treated as paid up by the consideration and any such cash.

(4) Where the consideration to be valued is accepted partly in payment up of the
nominal value of the shares and any premium and partly for some other
consideration given by the company, section 593 and the preceding provisions
of this section apply as if references to the consideration accepted by the
company included the proportion of that consideration that is properly
attributable to the payment up of that value and any premium.

(5) In such a case—
(a) the valuer must carry out, or arrange for, such other valuations as will
enable him to determine that proportion, and
(b) his report must state what valuations have been made under this
subsection and also the reason for, and method and date of, any such
valuation and any other matters which may be relevant to that

(3) below.

(2) If a company enters into an agreement in contravention of section 598 (public
company: agreement for transfer of non-cash asset in initial period) and—

the company,
(b) a person becomes a holder of shares allotted under the agreement, and
(c) by virtue of the agreement and allotment under it another person is

respect of—
(i) any other liability arising in relation to those shares under any
provision of this Chapter or Chapter 5, or
(ii) any liability arising by virtue of any undertaking given in or in

such undertaking, or

payment for the shares.

(3) In the case of a liability within subsection (1)(b), the court may exempt the

of liability arising in relation to the shares under any provision of this
Chapter or Chapter 5;
(b) whether any person other than the applicant has paid or is likely to pay,
whether in pursuance of any order of the court or otherwise, any such
amount.

(4) In determining whether it should exempt the applicant in whole or in part from
any liability, the court must have regard to the following overriding
principles—

money’s worth at least equal in value to the aggregate of the nominal
value of those shares and the whole of any premium or, if the case so
requires, so much of that aggregate as is treated as paid up;
(b) subject to this, that where such a company would, if the court did not
grant the exemption, have more than one remedy against a particular
person, it should be for the company to decide which remedy it should
remain entitled to pursue.

(5) If a person brings proceedings against another (“the contributor”) for a
contribution in respect of liability to a company arising under any provision of
this Chapter or Chapter 5 and it appears to the court that the contributor is

allotted to members as fully paid bonus shares.

mentioned in subsection (1) above.

_Relief from requirements as to share premiums_

**611** **Group reconstruction relief**

(a) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of another company (“the holding
company”), and
(b) allots shares—
(i) to the holding company, or
(ii) to another wholly-owned subsidiary of the holding company,
in consideration for the transfer to the issuing company of non-cash
assets of a company (“the transferor company”) that is a member of the
group of companies that comprises the holding company and all its
wholly-owned subsidiaries.

(2) Where the shares in the issuing company allotted in consideration for the
transfer are issued at a premium, the issuing company is not required by
section 610 to transfer any amount in excess of the minimum premium value
to the share premium account.

(3) The minimum premium value means the amount (if any) by which the base
value of the consideration for the shares allotted exceeds the aggregate
nominal value of the shares.

(4) The base value of the consideration for the shares allotted is the amount by
which the base value of the assets transferred exceeds the base value of any
liabilities of the transferor company assumed by the issuing company as part
of the consideration for the assets transferred.

(5) For the purposes of this section—
(a) the base value of assets transferred is taken as—
(i) the cost of those assets to the transferor company, or
(ii) if less, the amount at which those assets are stated in the
transferor company’s accounting records immediately before
the transfer;
(b) the base value of the liabilities assumed is taken as the amount at which
they are stated in the transferor company’s accounting records
immediately before the transfer.

**612** **Merger relief**

equity holding in another company in pursuance of an arrangement providing
for the allotment of equity shares in the issuing company on terms that the
consideration for the shares allotted is to be provided—
(a) by the issue or transfer to the issuing company of equity shares in the
other company, or
(b) by the cancellation of any such shares not held by the issuing company.

(2) If the equity shares in the issuing company allotted in pursuance of the
arrangement in consideration for the acquisition or cancellation of equity

295

_Companies Act 2006 (c._ **_46_** _)_
_Part 17 — A company’s share capital_
_Chapter 7 — Share premiums_

shares in the other company are issued at a premium, section 610 does not
apply to the premiums on those shares.

(3) Where the arrangement also provides for the allotment of any shares in the
issuing company on terms that the consideration for those shares is to be
provided—
(a) by the issue or transfer to the issuing company of non-equity shares in
the other company, or
(b) by the cancellation of any such shares in that company not held by the
issuing company,
relief under subsection (2) extends to any shares in the issuing company
allotted on those terms in pursuance of the arrangement.

(4) This section does not apply in a case falling within section 611 (group
reconstruction relief).

**613** **Merger relief: meaning of 90% equity holding**

(1) The following provisions have effect to determine for the purposes of section
612 (merger relief) whether a company (“company A”) has secured at least a
90% equity holding in another company (“company B”) in pursuance of such
an arrangement as is mentioned in subsection (1) of that section.

(2) Company A has secured at least a 90% equity holding in company B if in
consequence of an acquisition or cancellation of equity shares in company B (in
pursuance of that arrangement) it holds equity shares in company B of an
aggregate amount equal to 90% or more of the nominal value of that
company’s equity share capital.

(3) For this purpose—
(a) it is immaterial whether any of those shares were acquired in
pursuance of the arrangement; and
(b) shares in company B held by the company as treasury shares are
excluded in determining the nominal value of company B’s share
capital.

(4) Where the equity share capital of company B is divided into different classes of
shares, company A is not regarded as having secured at least a 90% equity
holding in company B unless the requirements of subsection (2) are met in
relation to each of those classes of shares taken separately.

(5) For the purposes of this section shares held by—
(a) a company that is company A’s holding company or subsidiary, or
(b) a subsidiary of company A’s holding company, or
(c) its or their nominees,
are treated as held by company A.

**614** **Power to make further provision by regulations**

(1) The Secretary of State may by regulations make such provision as he thinks
appropriate—
(a) for relieving companies from the requirements of section 610
(application of share premiums) in relation to premiums other than
cash premiums;

296

(b) for restricting or otherwise modifying any relief from those
requirements provided by this Chapter.

(2) Regulations under this section are subject to affirmative resolution procedure.

**615** **Relief may be reflected in company’s balance sheet**

An amount corresponding to the amount representing the premiums, or part
of the premiums, on shares issued by a company that by virtue of any relief
under this Chapter is not included in the company’s share premium account
may also be disregarded in determining the amount at which any shares or
other consideration provided for the shares issued is to be included in the
company’s balance sheet.

C LASSES  OF  SHARE  AND  CLASS  RIGHTS

_Introductory_

**629** **Classes of shares**

(1) For the purposes of the Companies Acts shares are of one class if the rights
attached to them are in all respects uniform.

(2) For this purpose the rights attached to shares are not regarded as different from
those attached to other shares by reason only that they do not carry the same
rights to dividends in the twelve months immediately following their
allotment.

_Variation of class rights_

**630** **Variation of class rights: companies having a share capital**

(1) This section is concerned with the variation of the rights attached to a class of
shares in a company having a share capital.

(2) Rights attached to a class of a company’s shares may only be varied—
(a) in accordance with provision in the company’s articles for the variation
of those rights, or
(b) where the company’s articles contain no such provision, if the holders
of shares of that class consent to the variation in accordance with this
section.

(3) This is without prejudice to any other restrictions on the variation of the rights.

(4) The consent required for the purposes of this section on the part of the holders
of a class of a company’s shares is—
(a) consent in writing from the holders of at least three-quarters in nominal
value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any shares held as
treasury shares), or
(b) a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders
of that class sanctioning the variation.

(5) Any amendment of a provision contained in a company’s articles for the
variation of the rights attached to a class of shares, or the insertion of any such
provision into the articles, is itself to be treated as a variation of those rights.

(6) In this section, and (except where the context otherwise requires) in any
provision in a company’s articles for the variation of the rights attached to a
class of shares, references to the variation of those rights include references to
their abrogation.

**631** **Variation of class rights: companies without a share capital**

(1) This section is concerned with the variation of the rights of a class of members
of a company where the company does not have a share capital.

of that class consent to the variation in accordance with this section.

(3) This is without prejudice to any other restrictions on the variation of the rights.

(4) The consent required for the purposes of this section on the part of the
members of a class is—
(a) consent in writing from at least three-quarters of the members of the
class, or
(b) a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the
members of that class sanctioning the variation.

(5) Any amendment of a provision contained in a company’s articles for the
variation of the rights of a class of members, or the insertion of any such
provision into the articles, is itself to be treated as a variation of those rights.

(6) In this section, and (except where the context otherwise requires) in any
provision in a company’s articles for the variation of the rights of a class of
members, references to the variation of those rights include references to their
abrogation.

**632** **Variation of class rights: saving for court’s powers under other provisions**

Nothing in section 630 or 631 (variation of class rights) affects the power of the
court under—
section 98 (application to cancel resolution for public company to be re-
registered as private),
Part 26 (arrangements and reconstructions), or
Part 30 (protection of members against unfair prejudice).

**633** **Right to object to variation: companies having a share capital**

(1) This section applies where the rights attached to any class of shares in a
company are varied under section 630 (variation of class rights: companies
having a share capital).

(2) The holders of not less in the aggregate than 15% of the issued shares of the
class in question (being persons who did not consent to or vote in favour of the
resolution for the variation) may apply to the court to have the variation
cancelled.
For this purpose any of the company’s share capital held as treasury shares is
disregarded.

(3) If such an application is made, the variation has no effect unless and until it is
confirmed by the court.

(4) Application to the court—
(a) must be made within 21 days after the date on which the consent was

apply to the court for an order confirming the reduction.

(2) If the proposed reduction of capital involves either—

(b) the payment to a shareholder of any paid-up share capital,
section 646 (creditors entitled to object to reduction) applies unless the court
directs otherwise.

(3) The court may, if having regard to any special circumstances of the case it
thinks proper to do so, direct that section 646 is not to apply as regards any
class or classes of creditors.

(4) The court may direct that section 646 is to apply in any other case.

**646** **Creditors entitled to object to reduction**

(1) Where this section applies (see section 645(2) and (4)), every creditor of the
company who at the date fixed by the court is entitled to any debt or claim that,
if that date were the commencement of the winding up of the company would
be admissible in proof against the company, is entitled to object to the
reduction of capital.

(2) The court shall settle a list of creditors entitled to object.

(3) For that purpose the court—
(a) shall ascertain, as far as possible without requiring an application from
any creditor, the names of those creditors and the nature and amount
of their debts or claims, and
(b) may publish notices fixing a day or days within which creditors not
entered on the list are to claim to be so entered or are to be excluded
from the right of objecting to the reduction of capital.

_Chapter 10 — Reduction of share capital_

(4) If a creditor entered on the list whose debt or claim is not discharged or has not
determined does not consent to the reduction, the court may, if it thinks fit,
dispense with the consent of that creditor on the company securing payment
of his debt or claim.

(5) For this purpose the debt or claim must be secured by appropriating (as the
court may direct) the following amount—
(a) if the company admits the full amount of the debt or claim or, though
not admitting it, is willing to provide for it, the full amount of the debt
or claim;
(b) if the company does not admit, and is not willing to provide for, the full
amount of the debt or claim, or if the amount is contingent or not
ascertained, an amount fixed by the court after the like enquiry and
adjudication as if the company were being wound up by the court.

creditor, or
(b) is knowingly concerned in any such concealment or misrepresentation,
he commits an offence.

maximum.

every creditor of the company who is entitled to object to the reduction of
capital that either—
(a) his consent to the reduction has been obtained, or
(b) his debt or claim has been discharged, or has determined or has been
secured.

(3) Where the court confirms the reduction, it may order the company to publish
(as the court directs) the reasons for reduction of capital, or such other
information in regard to it as the court thinks expedient with a view to giving
proper information to the public, and (if the court thinks fit) the causes that led
to the reduction.

(4) The court may, if for any special reason it thinks proper to do so, make an order
directing that the company must, during such period (commencing on or at
any time after the date of the order) as is specified in the order, add to its name
as its last words the words “and reduced”.

compromise or arrangement sanctioned by the court under Part 26

contributories in a winding up.

(1) In the following circumstances a company must transfer amounts to a reserve,
called the “capital redemption reserve”.

proceeds of a fresh issue, and
(b) the aggregate amount of the proceeds is less than the aggregate
nominal value of the shares redeemed or purchased,

under Chapter 5 in making the redemption or purchase.

the company’s capital redemption reserve.

may be reduced by a sum not exceeding (or by sums not in total exceeding) the
amount by which the permissible capital payment exceeds the nominal
amount of the shares.

(4) Where the proceeds of a fresh issue are applied by the company in making a
redemption or purchase of its own shares in addition to a payment out of
capital under this Chapter, the references in subsections (2) and (3) to the
permissible capital payment are to be read as referring to the aggregate of that
payment and those proceeds.

This is without prejudice to any right of the holder of the shares other than his
right to sue the company for damages in respect of its failure.

redemption or purchase if the company shows that it is unable to meet the costs
of redeeming or purchasing the shares in question out of distributable profits.

of the shares have not been redeemed or purchased, the terms of redemption
or purchase may be enforced against the company.

(b) during the period—
(i) beginning with the date on which the redemption or purchase
was to have taken place, and
(ii) ending with the commencement of the winding up,
the company could not at any time have lawfully made a distribution
equal in value to the price at which the shares were to have been
redeemed or purchased.

(6) There shall be paid in priority to any amount that the company is liable under
subsection (4) to pay in respect of any shares—
(a) all other debts and liabilities of the company (other than any due to
members in their character as such), and

are preferred to the rights as to capital attaching to the first-mentioned
shares, any amount due in satisfaction of those preferred rights.
Subject to that, any such amount shall be paid in priority to any amounts due
to members in satisfaction of their rights (whether as to capital or income) as
members.

(1) Any provision contained in—
(a) a trust deed for securing an issue of debentures, or
(b) any contract with the holders of debentures secured by a trust deed,
is void in so far as it would have the effect of exempting a trustee of the deed
from, or indemnifying him against, liability for breach of trust where he fails to
show the degree of care and diligence required of him as trustee, having regard
to the provisions of the trust deed conferring on him any powers, authorities
or discretions.

(2) Subsection (1) does not invalidate—
(a) a release otherwise validly given in respect of anything done or omitted
to be done by a trustee before the giving of the release;



-----


_Companies Act 2006 (c._ **_46_** _)_

_Part 19 — Debentures_
358

(b) any provision enabling such a release to be given—
(i) on being agreed to by a majority of not less than 75% in value of
the debenture holders present and voting in person or, where
proxies are permitted, by proxy at a meeting summoned for the
purpose, and
(ii) either with respect to specific acts or omissions or on the trustee
dying or ceasing to act.

(3) This section is subject to section 751 (saving for certain older provisions).

**751** **Liability of trustees of debentures: saving for certain older provisions**

(1) Section 750 (liability of trustees of debentures) does not operate—
(a) to invalidate any provision in force on the relevant date so long as any
person—
(i) then entitled to the benefit of the provision, or
(ii) afterwards given the benefit of the provision under subsection
(3) below,
remains a trustee of the deed in question, or
(b) to deprive any person of any exemption or right to be indemnified in
respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him while any such
provision was in force.

(2) The relevant date for this purpose is—
(a) 1st July 1948 in a case where section 192 of the Companies Act 1985
(c. 6) applied immediately before the commencement of this section;
(b) 1st July 1961 in a case where Article 201 of the Companies (Northern
Ireland) Order 1986 (S.I. 1986/1032 (N.I. 6)) then applied.

(3) While any trustee of a trust deed remains entitled to the benefit of a provision
saved by subsection (1) above the benefit of that provision may be given
either—
(a) to all trustees of the deed, present and future, or
(b) to any named trustees or proposed trustees of it,
by a resolution passed by a majority of not less than 75% in value of the
debenture holders present in person or, where proxies are permitted, by proxy
at a meeting summoned for the purpose.

(4) A meeting for that purpose must be summoned in accordance with the
provisions of the deed or, if the deed makes no provision for summoning
meetings, in a manner approved by the court.

**752** **Power to re-issue redeemed debentures**

(1) Where a company has redeemed debentures previously issued, then unless—
(a) provision to the contrary (express or implied) is contained in the
company’s articles or in any contract made by the company, or
(b) the company has, by passing a resolution to that effect or by some other
act, manifested its intention that the debentures shall be cancelled,
the company may re-issue the debentures, either by re-issuing the same
debentures or by issuing new debentures in their place.
This subsection is deemed always to have had effect.



-----


_Companies Act 2006 (c._ **_46_** _)_
_Part 19 — Debentures_
359

(2) On a re-issue of redeemed debentures the person entitled to the debentures has
(and is deemed always to have had) the same priorities as if the debentures had
never been redeemed.

(3) The re-issue of a debenture or the issue of another debenture in its place under
this section is treated as the issue of a new debenture for the purposes of stamp
duty.
It is not so treated for the purposes of any provision limiting the amount or
number of debentures to be issued.

(4) A person lending money on the security of a debenture re-issued under this
section which appears to be duly stamped may give the debenture in evidence
in any proceedings for enforcing his security without payment of the stamp
duty or any penalty in respect of it, unless he had notice (or, but for his
negligence, might have discovered) that the debenture was not duly stamped.
In that case the company is liable to pay the proper stamp duty and penalty.

**753** **Deposit of debentures to secure advances**

Where a company has deposited any of its debentures to secure advances from
time to time on current account or otherwise, the debentures are not treated as
redeemed by reason only of the company’s account having ceased to be in
debit while the debentures remained so deposited.

**754** **Priorities where debentures secured by floating charge**

(1) This section applies where debentures of a company registered in England and
Wales or Northern Ireland are secured by a charge that, as created, was a
floating charge.

(2) If possession is taken, by or on behalf of the holders of the debentures, of any
property comprised in or subject to the charge, and the company is not at that
time in the course of being wound up, the company’s preferential debts shall
be paid out of assets coming to the hands of the persons taking possession in
priority to any claims for principal or interest in respect of the debentures.

(3) “Preferential debts” means the categories of debts listed in Schedule 6 to the
Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45) or Schedule 4 to the Insolvency (Northern Ireland)
Order 1989 (S.I. 1989/2405 (N.I. 19)).
For the purposes of those Schedules “the relevant date” is the date of
possession being taken as mentioned in subsection (2).

(4) Payments under this section shall be recouped, as far as may be, out of the
assets of the company available for payment of general creditors.

(c) no further shares may be issued in right of the shares or in pursuance
of an offer made to their holder;
(d) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the
company on the shares, whether in respect of capital or otherwise.

(2) Where shares are subject to the restriction in subsection (1)(a), an agreement to

order under section 800 made by virtue of subsection (3)(b) (removal of
restrictions in case of court-approved transfer).

(3) Where shares are subject to the restriction in subsection (1)(c) or (d), an
agreement to transfer any right to be issued with other shares in right of those
shares, or to receive any payment on them (otherwise than in a liquidation), is
void.
This does not apply to an agreement to transfer any such right on the making
of an order under section 800 made by virtue of subsection (3)(b) (removal of
restrictions in case of court-approved transfer).

(b) votes in respect of any such shares (whether as holder or proxy), or

(c) being the holder of any such shares, fails to notify of their being subject
to those restrictions a person whom he does not know to be aware of
that fact but does know to be entitled (apart from the restrictions) to
vote in respect of those shares whether as holder or as proxy, or
(d) being the holder of any such shares, or being entitled to a right to be
issued with other shares in right of them, or to receive any payment on

(3) If the court is satisfied that the application is well-founded, it may, for the

relate to a right acquired or offer made before the transfer.

the applicant’s interest in the shares bears to the total value of the
shares.
This is subject to the following qualification.

company is to the exercise of any rights or of any control or influence arising
from those interests (including the right to enter into an agreement for the
exercise, or for control of the exercise, of any of those rights by another person).

(4) Once an interest in shares in the target company has been acquired in
pursuance of the agreement, this section continues to apply to the agreement
so long as the agreement continues to include provisions of any description
mentioned in subsection (2).
This applies irrespective of—
(a) whether or not any further acquisitions of interests in the company’s
shares take place in pursuance of the agreement;
(b) any change in the persons who are for the time being parties to it;
(c) any variation of the agreement.
References in this subsection to the agreement include any agreement having
effect (whether directly or indirectly) in substitution for the original
agreement.

(5) In this section—
(a) “agreement” includes any agreement or arrangement, and
(b) references to provisions of an agreement include—

in the undertakings, expectations or understandings of the parties to it;
or
(b) to an agreement to underwrite or sub-underwrite an offer of shares in
a company, provided the agreement is confined to that purpose and
any matters incidental to it.

**825** **Extent of obligation in case of share acquisition agreement**

(1) For the purposes of this Part each party to an agreement to which section 824
applies is treated as interested in all shares in the target company in which any
other party to the agreement is interested apart from the agreement (whether



-----

_Part 22 — Information about interests in a company’s shares_
390

or not the interest of the other party was acquired, or includes any interest that
was acquired, in pursuance of the agreement).

(2) For those purposes an interest of a party to such an agreement in shares in the
target company is an interest apart from the agreement if he is interested in
those shares otherwise than by virtue of the application of section 824 (and this
section) in relation to the agreement.

(3) Accordingly, any such interest of the person (apart from the agreement)
includes for those purposes any interest treated as his under section 822 or 823
(family or corporate interests) or by the application of section 824 (and this
section) in relation to any other agreement with respect to shares in the target
company to which he is a party.

(4) A notification with respect to his interest in shares in the target company made
to the company under this Part by a person who is for the time being a party to
an agreement to which section 824 applies must—
(a) state that the person making the notification is a party to such an
agreement,
(b) include the names and (so far as known to him) the addresses of the
other parties to the agreement, identifying them as such, and
(c) state whether or not any of the shares to which the notification relates
are shares in which he is interested by virtue of section 824 (and this
section) and, if so, the number of those shares.

(a) must not be included in a report under section 805 (report to members
on outcome of investigation), and
(b) must not be made available under section 811 (right to inspect and
request copy of entries).

(2) Where any such information is omitted from a report under section 805, that
fact must be stated in the report.

**827** **Reckoning of periods for fulfilling obligations**

Where the period allowed by any provision of this Part for fulfilling an
obligation is expressed as a number of days, any day that is not a working day
shall be disregarded in reckoning that period.

**879** **Charges which have to be registered: supplementary**

created by a heritable security within the meaning of section 9(8) of the
Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 (c. 35).

**881** **Charge by way of ex facie absolute disposition, etc**

(1) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that, in the case of a charge
created by way of an _ex facie_ absolute disposition or assignation qualified by a
back letter or other agreement, or by a standard security qualified by an
agreement, compliance with section 878(1) does not of itself render the charge
unavailable as security for indebtedness incurred after the date of compliance.

(2) Where the amount secured by a charge so created is purported to be increased
by a further back letter or agreement, a further charge is held to have been
created by the _ex facie_ absolute disposition or assignation or (as the case may
be) by the standard security, as qualified by the further back letter or
agreement.

(3) In that case, the provisions of this Chapter apply to the further charge as if—
(a) references in this Chapter (other than in this section) to a charge were
references to the further charge, and

date on which the further back letter or agreement was executed.

(1) Where a series of debentures containing, or giving by reference to any other
instrument, any charge to the benefit of which the debenture-holders of that

deed containing the charge (or, if there is no such deed, of one of the
debentures of the series) are delivered to the registrar before the end of the
period allowed for registration.

(2) The following are the required particulars—
(a) the total amount secured by the whole series,
(b) the dates of the resolutions authorising the issue of the series and the
date of the covering deed (if any) by which the security is created or
defined,
(c) a general description of the property charged,
(d) the names of the trustees (if any) for the debenture-holders, and
(e) in the case of a floating charge, a statement of any provisions of the
charge and of any instrument relating to it which prohibit or restrict or
regulate the power of the company to grant further securities ranking
in priority to, or _pari passu_ with, the floating charge, or which vary or
otherwise regulate the order of ranking of the floating charge in
relation to subsisting securities.

(3) Where more than one issue is made of debentures in the series, particulars of
the date and amount of each issue of debentures of the series must be sent to
the registrar for entry in the register of charges.

debentures.

(5) Subsections (2) to (6) of section 878 apply for the purposes of this section as
they apply for the purposes of that section but as if for the reference to the

conditional, for such debentures,
the particulars required to be sent for registration under section 878 shall
include particulars as to the amount or rate per cent. of the commission,
discount or allowance so paid or made.

(2) The deposit of debentures as security for a debt of the company is not, for the
purposes of this section, treated as the issue of debentures at a discount.

(3) Failure to comply with this section does not affect the validity of the
debentures issued.

_Charges on property outside the United Kingdom_

**884** **Charges on property outside United Kingdom**

Where a charge is created in the United Kingdom but comprises property

acceptance of the bid by—
(a) rules under section 943(1) giving effect to Article 7.1 of the
Takeovers Directive, or
(b) where the rules giving effect to that Article which apply to the
bid are those of an EEA State other than the United Kingdom,
those rules;

“the Takeovers Directive” means Directive 2004/25/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council;

if they carry voting rights.

**972** **Transitory provision**

(1) Where a takeover bid is made for an opted-in company, section 368 of the

requisition) and section 378 of that Act (extraordinary and special resolutions)
have effect as follows until their repeal by this Act.

_Takeover offers_

**974** **Meaning of “takeover offer”**

(1) For the purposes of this Chapter an offer to acquire shares in a company is a
“takeover offer” if the following two conditions are satisfied in relation to the
offer.

(2) The first condition is that it is an offer to acquire—
(a) all the shares in a company, or
(b) where there is more than one class of shares in a company, all the shares
of one or more classes,
other than shares that at the date of the offer are already held by the offeror.
Section 975 contains provision supplementing this subsection.

(3) The second condition is that the terms of the offer are the same—
(a) in relation to all the shares to which the offer relates, or
(b) where the shares to which the offer relates include shares of different
classes, in relation to all the shares of each class.
Section 976 contains provision treating this condition as satisfied in certain
circumstances.

(4) In subsections (1) to (3) “shares” means shares, other than relevant treasury
shares, that have been allotted on the date of the offer (but see subsection (5)).

(5) A takeover offer may include among the shares to which it relates—



-----


463

_Companies Act 2006 (c._ **_46_** _)_
_Part 28 — Takeovers etc_
_Chapter 3 — “Squeeze-out” and “Sell-out”_

(a) all or any shares that are allotted after the date of the offer but before a
specified date;
(b) all or any relevant treasury shares that cease to be held as treasury
shares before a specified date;
(c) all or any other relevant treasury shares.

(6) In this section—
“relevant treasury shares” means shares that—
(a) are held by the company as treasury shares on the date of the
offer, or
(b) become shares held by the company as treasury shares after that
date but before a specified date;
“specified date” means a date specified in or determined in accordance
with the terms of the offer.

(7) Where the terms of an offer make provision for their revision and for
acceptances on the previous terms to be treated as acceptances on the revised
terms, then, if the terms of the offer are revised in accordance with that
provision—
(a) the revision is not to be regarded for the purposes of this Chapter as the
making of a fresh offer, and
(b) references in this Chapter to the date of the offer are accordingly to be
read as references to the date of the original offer.

**975** **Shares already held by the offeror etc**

(1) The reference in section 974(2) to shares already held by the offeror includes a
reference to shares that he has contracted to acquire, whether unconditionally
or subject to conditions being met.
This is subject to subsection (2).

(2) The reference in section 974(2) to shares already held by the offeror does not
include a reference to shares that are the subject of a contract—
(a) intended to secure that the holder of the shares will accept the offer
when it is made, and
(b) entered into—
(i) by deed and for no consideration,
(ii) for consideration of negligible value, or
(iii) for consideration consisting of a promise by the offeror to make
the offer.

(3) In relation to Scotland, this section applies as if the words “by deed and” in
subsection (2)(b)(i) were omitted.

(4) The condition in section 974(2) is treated as satisfied where—
(a) the offer does not extend to shares that associates of the offeror hold or
have contracted to acquire (whether unconditionally or subject to
conditions being met), and
(b) the condition would be satisfied if the offer did extend to those shares.
(For further provision about such shares, see section 977(2)).

_Part 28 — Takeovers etc_

_Chapter 3 — “Squeeze-out” and “Sell-out”_

**976** **Cases where offer treated as being on same terms**

(1) The condition in section 974(3) (terms of offer to be the same for all shares or
all shares of particular classes) is treated as satisfied where subsection (2) or (3)
below applies.

(2) This subsection applies where—
(a) shares carry an entitlement to a particular dividend which other shares
of the same class, by reason of being allotted later, do not carry,
(b) there is a difference in the value of consideration offered for the shares
allotted earlier as against that offered for those allotted later,
(c) that difference merely reflects the difference in entitlement to the
dividend, and
(d) the condition in section 974(3) would be satisfied but for that difference.

(3) This subsection applies where—
(a) the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom—
(i) precludes an offer of consideration in the form, or any of the
forms, specified in the terms of the offer (“the specified form”),
or
(ii) precludes it except after compliance by the offeror with
conditions with which he is unable to comply or which he
regards as unduly onerous,
(b) the persons to whom an offer of consideration in the specified form is
precluded are able to receive consideration in another form that is of
substantially equivalent value, and
(c) the condition in section 974(3) would be satisfied but for the fact that an
offer of consideration in the specified form to those persons is
precluded.

**977** **Shares to which an offer relates**

(1) Where a takeover offer is made and, during the period beginning with the date
of the offer and ending when the offer can no longer be accepted, the offeror—
(a) acquires or unconditionally contracts to acquire any of the shares to
which the offer relates, but
(b) does not do so by virtue of acceptances of the offer,
those shares are treated for the purposes of this Chapter as excluded from those
to which the offer relates.

(2) For the purposes of this Chapter shares that an associate of the offeror holds or
has contracted to acquire, whether at the date of the offer or subsequently, are
not treated as shares to which the offer relates, even if the offer extends to such
shares.
In this subsection “contracted” means contracted unconditionally or subject to
conditions being met.

(3) This section is subject to section 979(8) and (9).

**978** **Effect of impossibility etc of communicating or accepting offer**

(1) Where there are holders of shares in a company to whom an offer to acquire
shares in the company is not communicated, that does not prevent the offer
from being a takeover offer for the purposes of this Chapter if—



-----


465

_Companies Act 2006 (c._ **_46_** _)_
_Part 28 — Takeovers etc_
_Chapter 3 — “Squeeze-out” and “Sell-out”_

(a) those shareholders have no registered address in the United Kingdom,
(b) the offer was not communicated to those shareholders in order not to
contravene the law of a country or territory outside the United
Kingdom, and
(c) either—
(i) the offer is published in the Gazette, or
(ii) the offer can be inspected, or a copy of it obtained, at a place in
an EEA State or on a website, and a notice is published in the
Gazette specifying the address of that place or website.

(2) Where an offer is made to acquire shares in a company and there are persons
for whom, by reason of the law of a country or territory outside the United
Kingdom, it is impossible to accept the offer, or more difficult to do so, that
does not prevent the offer from being a takeover offer for the purposes of this
Chapter.

(3) It is not to be inferred—
(a) that an offer which is not communicated to every holder of shares in the
company cannot be a takeover offer for the purposes of this Chapter
unless the requirements of paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (1) are
met, or
(b) that an offer which is impossible, or more difficult, for certain persons
to accept cannot be a takeover offer for those purposes unless the
reason for the impossibility or difficulty is the one mentioned in
subsection (2).

_“Squeeze-out”_

**979** **Right of offeror to buy out minority shareholder**

(1) Subsection (2) applies in a case where a takeover offer does not relate to shares
of different classes.

(2) If the offeror has, by virtue of acceptances of the offer, acquired or
unconditionally contracted to acquire—
(a) not less than 90% in value of the shares to which the offer relates, and
(b) in a case where the shares to which the offer relates are voting shares,
not less than 90% of the voting rights carried by those shares,
he may give notice to the holder of any shares to which the offer relates which
the offeror has not acquired or unconditionally contracted to acquire that he
desires to acquire those shares.

(3) Subsection (4) applies in a case where a takeover offer relates to shares of
different classes.

(4) If the offeror has, by virtue of acceptances of the offer, acquired or
unconditionally contracted to acquire—
(a) not less than 90% in value of the shares of any class to which the offer
relates, and
(b) in a case where the shares of that class are voting shares, not less than
90% of the voting rights carried by those shares,
he may give notice to the holder of any shares of that class to which the offer
relates which the offeror has not acquired or unconditionally contracted to
acquire that he desires to acquire those shares.

_Companies Act 2006 (c._ **_46_** _)_
_Part 28 — Takeovers etc_

_Chapter 3 — “Squeeze-out” and “Sell-out”_

(5) In the case of a takeover offer which includes among the shares to which it
relates—
(a) shares that are allotted after the date of the offer, or
(b) relevant treasury shares (within the meaning of section 974) that cease
to be held as treasury shares after the date of the offer,
the offeror’s entitlement to give a notice under subsection (2) or (4) on any
particular date shall be determined as if the shares to which the offer relates did
not include any allotted, or ceasing to be held as treasury shares, on or after that
date.

(6) Subsection (7) applies where—
(a) the requirements for the giving of a notice under subsection (2) or (4)
are satisfied, and
(b) there are shares in the company which the offeror, or an associate of his,
has contracted to acquire subject to conditions being met, and in
relation to which the contract has not become unconditional.

(7) The offeror’s entitlement to give a notice under subsection (2) or (4) shall be
determined as if—
(a) the shares to which the offer relates included shares falling within
paragraph (b) of subsection (6), and
(b) in relation to shares falling within that paragraph, the words “by virtue
of acceptances of the offer” in subsection (2) or (4) were omitted.

(8) Where—
(a) a takeover offer is made,
(b) during the period beginning with the date of the offer and ending when
the offer can no longer be accepted, the offeror—
(i) acquires or unconditionally contracts to acquire any of the
shares to which the offer relates, but
(ii) does not do so by virtue of acceptances of the offer, and
(c) subsection (10) applies,
then for the purposes of this section those shares are not excluded by section
977(1) from those to which the offer relates, and the offeror is treated as having
acquired or contracted to acquire them by virtue of acceptances of the offer.

(9) Where—
(a) a takeover offer is made,
(b) during the period beginning with the date of the offer and ending when
the offer can no longer be accepted, an associate of the offeror acquires
or unconditionally contracts to acquire any of the shares to which the
offer relates, and
(c) subsection (10) applies,
then for the purposes of this section those shares are not excluded by section
977(2) from those to which the offer relates.

(10) This subsection applies if—
(a) at the time the shares are acquired or contracted to be acquired as
mentioned in subsection (8) or (9) (as the case may be), the value of the
consideration for which they are acquired or contracted to be acquired
(“the acquisition consideration”) does not exceed the value of the
consideration specified in the terms of the offer, or
(b) those terms are subsequently revised so that when the revision is
announced the value of the acquisition consideration, at the time



-----

_Companies Act 2006 (c._ **_46_** _)_
_Part 28 — Takeovers etc_
_Chapter 3 — “Squeeze-out” and “Sell-out”_

mentioned in paragraph (a), no longer exceeds the value of the
consideration specified in those terms.

**980** **Further provision about notices given under section 979**

(1) A notice under section 979 must be given in the prescribed manner.

(2) No notice may be given under section 979(2) or (4) after the end of—
(a) the period of three months beginning with the day after the last day on
which the offer can be accepted, or
(b) the period of six months beginning with the date of the offer, where that
period ends earlier and the offer is one to which subsection (3) below
applies.

(3) This subsection applies to an offer if the time allowed for acceptance of the offer
is not governed by rules under section 943(1) that give effect to Article 7 of the
Takeovers Directive.
In this subsection “the Takeovers Directive” has the same meaning as in section
943.

(4) At the time when the offeror first gives a notice under section 979 in relation to
an offer, he must send to the company—
(a) a copy of the notice, and
(b) a statutory declaration by him in the prescribed form, stating that the
conditions for the giving of the notice are satisfied.

**981** **Effect of notice under section 979**

(1) Subject to section 986 (applications to the court), this section applies where the
offeror gives a shareholder a notice under section 979.

(2) The offeror is entitled and bound to acquire the shares to which the notice
relates on the terms of the offer.

(3) Where the terms of an offer are such as to give the shareholder a choice of
consideration, the notice must give particulars of the choice and state—
(a) that the shareholder may, within six weeks from the date of the notice,
indicate his choice by a written communication sent to the offeror at an
address specified in the notice, and
(b) which consideration specified in the offer will apply if he does not
indicate a choice.
The reference in subsection (2) to the terms of the offer is to be read
accordingly.

(4) Subsection (3) applies whether or not any time-limit or other conditions
applicable to the choice under the terms of the offer can still be complied with.

(5) If the consideration offered to or (as the case may be) chosen by the
shareholder—
(a) is not cash and the offeror is no longer able to provide it, or
(b) was to have been provided by a third party who is no longer bound or
able to provide it,
the consideration is to be taken to consist of an amount of cash, payable by the
offeror, which at the date of the notice is equivalent to the consideration offered
or (as the case may be) chosen.

(6) At the end of six weeks from the date of the notice the offeror must
immediately—
(a) send a copy of the notice to the company, and
(b) pay or transfer to the company the consideration for the shares to which
the notice relates.
Where the consideration consists of shares or securities to be allotted by the
offeror, the reference in paragraph (b) to the transfer of the consideration is to
be read as a reference to the allotment of the shares or securities to the
company.

(7) If the shares to which the notice relates are registered, the copy of the notice
sent to the company under subsection (6)(a) must be accompanied by an
instrument of transfer executed on behalf of the holder of the shares by a
person appointed by the offeror.
On receipt of that instrument the company must register the offeror as the
holder of those shares.

(8) If the shares to which the notice relates are transferable by the delivery of
warrants or other instruments, the copy of the notice sent to the company
under subsection (6)(a) must be accompanied by a statement to that effect.
On receipt of that statement the company must issue the offeror with warrants
or other instruments in respect of the shares, and those already in issue in
respect of the shares become void.

(9) The company must hold any money or other consideration received by it
under subsection (6)(b) on trust for the person who, before the offeror acquired

them, was entitled to the shares in respect of which the money or other
consideration was received.
Section 982 contains further provision about how the company should deal
with such money or other consideration.

**982** **Further provision about consideration held on trust under section 981(9)**

(1) This section applies where an offeror pays or transfers consideration to the
company under section 981(6).

(2) The company must pay into a separate bank account that complies with
subsection (3)—
(a) any money it receives under paragraph (b) of section 981(6), and
(b) any dividend or other sum accruing from any other consideration it
receives under that paragraph.

(3) A bank account complies with this subsection if the balance on the account—
(a) bears interest at an appropriate rate, and
(b) can be withdrawn by such notice (if any) as is appropriate.

(4) If—
(a) the person entitled to the consideration held on trust by virtue of
section 981(9) cannot be found, and
(b) subsection (5) applies,
the consideration (together with any interest, dividend or other benefit that has
accrued from it) must be paid into court.

(5) This subsection applies where—
(a) reasonable enquiries have been made at reasonable intervals to find the
person, and
(b) twelve years have elapsed since the consideration was received, or the
company is wound up.

(6) In relation to a company registered in Scotland, subsections (7) and (8) apply
instead of subsection (4).

(7) If the person entitled to the consideration held on trust by virtue of section
981(9) cannot be found and subsection (5) applies—
(a) the trust terminates,
(b) the company or (if the company is wound up) the liquidator must sell
any consideration other than cash and any benefit other than cash that
has accrued from the consideration, and
(c) a sum representing—
(i) the consideration so far as it is cash,
(ii) the proceeds of any sale under paragraph (b), and
(iii) any interest, dividend or other benefit that has accrued from the
consideration,
must be deposited in the name of the Accountant of Court in a separate
bank account complying with subsection (3) and the receipt for the
deposit must be transmitted to the Accountant of Court.

_Part 28 — Takeovers etc_
_Chapter 3 — “Squeeze-out” and “Sell-out”_

the holder of any shares of that class to which the offer relates who has not
accepted the offer may require the offeror to acquire those shares.

(5) For the purposes of subsections (2) to (4), in calculating 90% of the value of any
shares, shares held by the company as treasury shares are to be treated as
having been acquired by the offeror.

(6) Subsection (7) applies where—
(a) a shareholder exercises rights conferred on him by subsection (2), (3) or
(4),
(b) at the time when he does so, there are shares in the company which the
offeror has contracted to acquire subject to conditions being met, and in
relation to which the contract has not become unconditional, and
(c) the requirement imposed by subsection (2)(b), (3)(b) or (4)(b) (as the
case may be) would not be satisfied if those shares were not taken into
account.

(7) The shareholder is treated for the purposes of section 985 as not having
exercised his rights under this section unless the requirement imposed by
paragraph (b) of subsection (2), (3) or (4) (as the case may be) would be satisfied
if—
(a) the reference in that paragraph to other shares in the company which
the offeror has contracted to acquire unconditionally or subject to
conditions being met were a reference to such shares which he has
unconditionally contracted to acquire, and
(b) the reference in that subsection to the period within which the offer can
be accepted were a reference to the period referred to in section 984(2).

(8) A reference in subsection (2)(b), (3)(b), (4)(b), (6) or (7) to shares which the
offeror has acquired or contracted to acquire includes a reference to shares
which an associate of his has acquired or contracted to acquire.

_Chapter 3 — “Squeeze-out” and “Sell-out”_

If the offeror is a company, every officer of that company who is in default or
to whose neglect the failure is attributable also commits an offence.

(6) If an offeror other than a company is charged with an offence for failing to
comply with subsection (3), it is a defence for him to prove that he took all
reasonable steps for securing compliance with that subsection.

(7) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable—
(a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine;
(b) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum
and, for continued contravention, a daily default fine not exceeding
one-fiftieth of the statutory maximum.

**985** **Effect of requirement under section 983**

(1) Subject to section 986, this section applies where a shareholder exercises his
rights under section 983 in respect of any shares held by him.

(2) The offeror is entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the terms of the
offer or on such other terms as may be agreed.

(3) Where the terms of an offer are such as to give the shareholder a choice of
consideration—
(a) the shareholder may indicate his choice when requiring the offeror to
acquire the shares, and
(b) the notice given to the shareholder under section 984(3)—
(i) must give particulars of the choice and of the rights conferred
by this subsection, and
(ii) may state which consideration specified in the offer will apply
if he does not indicate a choice.
The reference in subsection (2) to the terms of the offer is to be read
accordingly.

(4) Subsection (3) applies whether or not any time-limit or other conditions
applicable to the choice under the terms of the offer can still be complied with.

(5) If the consideration offered to or (as the case may be) chosen by the
shareholder—
(a) is not cash and the offeror is no longer able to provide it, or
(b) was to have been provided by a third party who is no longer bound or
able to provide it,
the consideration is to be taken to consist of an amount of cash, payable by the
offeror, which at the date when the shareholder requires the offeror to acquire
the shares is equivalent to the consideration offered or (as the case may be)
chosen.

_Supplementary_

**986** **Applications to the court**

shares held by him, the court may, on an application made by him or the
offeror, order that the terms on which the offeror is entitled and bound to
acquire the shares shall be such as the court thinks fit.

(4) On an application under subsection (1) or (3)—
(a) the court may not require consideration of a higher value than that
specified in the terms of the offer (“the offer value”) to be given for the
shares to which the application relates unless the holder of the shares
shows that the offer value would be unfair;
(b) the court may not require consideration of a lower value than the offer
value to be given for the shares.

(5) No order for costs or expenses may be made against a shareholder making an
application under subsection (1) or (3) unless the court considers that—

(9) Where a takeover offer has not been accepted to the extent necessary for
entitling the offeror to give notices under subsection (2) or (4) of section 979 the
court may, on an application made by him, make an order authorising him to
give notices under that subsection if it is satisfied that—
(a) the offeror has after reasonable enquiry been unable to trace one or
more of the persons holding shares to which the offer relates,
(b) the requirements of that subsection would have been met if the person,
or all the persons, mentioned in paragraph (a) above had accepted the
offer, and
(c) the consideration offered is fair and reasonable.
This is subject to subsection (10).

delivered, subject to the provisions of section 1073 (power to accept documents
not meeting requirements for proper delivery).

**1073 Power to accept documents not meeting requirements for proper delivery**

(1) The registrar may accept (and register) a document that does not comply with
the requirements for proper delivery.

(2) A document accepted by the registrar under this section is treated as received
by the registrar for the purposes of section 1077 (public notice of receipt of
certain documents).

(3) No objection may be taken to the legal consequences of a document’s being
accepted (or registered) by the registrar under this section on the ground that
the requirements for proper delivery were not met.

(4) The acceptance of a document by the registrar under this section does not
affect—
(a) the continuing obligation to comply with the requirements for proper
delivery, or
(b) subject as follows, any liability for failure to comply with those
requirements.

(5) For the purposes of—
(a) section 453 (civil penalty for failure to file accounts and reports), and
(b) any enactment imposing a daily default fine for failure to deliver the
document,
the period after the document is accepted does not count as a period during
which there is default in complying with the requirements for proper delivery.

(6) But if, subsequently—
(a) the registrar issues a notice under section 1094(4) in respect of the
document (notice of administrative removal from the register), and
(b) the requirements for proper delivery are not complied with before the
end of the period of 14 days after the issue of that notice,
any subsequent period of default does count for the purposes of those
provisions.

**1074 Documents containing unnecessary material**

(1) This section applies where a document delivered to the registrar contains
unnecessary material.

(2) “Unnecessary material” means material that—
(a) is not necessary in order to comply with an obligation under any
enactment, and
(b) is not specifically authorised to be delivered to the registrar.

(3) For this purpose an obligation to deliver a document of a particular
description, or conforming to certain requirements, is regarded as not
extending to anything that is not needed for a document of that description or,
as the case may be, conforming to those requirements.

(4) If the unnecessary material cannot readily be separated from the rest of the
document, the document is treated as not meeting the requirements for proper
delivery.

_Part 35 — The registrar of companies_
521

(5) If the unnecessary material can readily be separated from the rest of the
document, the registrar may register the document either—
(a) with the omission of the unnecessary material, or
(b) as delivered.

**1075 Informal correction of document**

(1) A document delivered to the registrar may be corrected by the registrar if it
appears to the registrar to be incomplete or internally inconsistent.

(2) This power is exercisable only—
(a) on instructions, and
(b) if the company has given (and has not withdrawn) its consent to
instructions being given under this section.

(3) The following requirements must be met as regards the instructions—
(a) the instructions must be given in response to an enquiry by the
registrar;
(b) the registrar must be satisfied that the person giving the instructions is
authorised to do so—
(i) by the person by whom the document was delivered, or
(ii) by the company to which the document relates;
(c) the instructions must meet any requirements of registrar’s rules as to—
(i) the form and manner in which they are given, and
(ii) authentication.

(4) The company’s consent to instructions being given under this section (and any
withdrawal of such consent)—
(a) may be in hard copy or electronic form, and
(b) must be notified to the registrar.

(5) This section applies in relation to documents delivered under Part 25
(company charges) by a person other than the company as if the references to
the company were to the company or the person by whom the document was
delivered.

(6) A document that is corrected under this section is treated, for the purposes of
any enactment relating to its delivery, as having been delivered when the
correction is made.

(7) The power conferred by this section is not exercisable if the document has been
registered under section 1073 (power to accept documents not meeting
requirements for proper delivery).

**1076 Replacement of document not meeting requirements for proper delivery**

(1) The registrar may accept a replacement for a document previously delivered
that—
(a) did not comply with the requirements for proper delivery, or
(b) contained unnecessary material (within the meaning of section 1074).

(2) A replacement document must not be accepted unless the registrar is satisfied
that it is delivered by—
(a) the person by whom the original document was delivered, or

_Part 35 — The registrar of companies_
522

(b) the company to which the original document relates,
and that it complies with the requirements for proper delivery.

(3) The power of the registrar to impose requirements as to the form and manner
of delivery includes power to impose requirements as to the identification of
the original document and the delivery of the replacement in a form and
manner enabling it to be associated with the original.

(4) This section does not apply where the original document was delivered under
Part 25 (company charges) (but see sections 873 and 888 (rectification of
register of charges)).

_Public notice of receipt of certain documents_
