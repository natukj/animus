If the market value of the property is $180 million but the\ncash payment is only $50 million, there is a net shift of value from\ncompany A to company B of $130 million.\n\n(2) It is called indirect because the transaction will have the indirect\neffect of shifting value from equity or loan interests in the losing\nentity to equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.\n\nThis is because the net shift in value between the entities will\nusually decrease the market value of interests in the losing entity\nand increase the market value of interests in the gaining entity.\n\nExample: Assume that company C owns all the shares in company A and\ncompany D owns all the shares in company B. The net shift of value\nfrom company A to company B will reduce the value of company C\u2019s\nshares in company A and increase the value of company D\u2019s shares in\ncompany B.\n\n_____________________________________\n*To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_48_ _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\n\n-----\n\nValue shifting Part 3-95\n\nIndirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and arising from\nnon-arm\u2019s length dealings Division 727\n\n##### Section 727-5\n\n(3) It will also produce corresponding effects further up a chain of\nentities.\n\nExample: Assume that company E owns all the shares in company C and\ncompany D.
