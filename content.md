**Part 3-95 Value shifting**
**Division 723 Direct value shifting by creating right over non-depreciating asset**

##### Section 723-10

(a) value has been shifted out of the asset by the owner creating
in an associate a right over the asset; and

(b) the value shifted was not brought to tax when the right was
created and has not since been brought to tax on a realisation
of the right.

##### 723-10 Reduction in loss from realising non-depreciating asset over which right has been created

(1) A loss that would, apart from this Division, be *realised for income
tax purposes by a *realisation event is reduced by the amount
worked out under subsections (3) and (4) if:

(a) the event happens to a *CGT asset (the underlying asset) you
own that, at the time of the event (the realisation time):

(i) is not a *depreciating asset; or

(ii) is an item of your *trading stock; or

(iii) is a *revenue asset of yours; and

(b) before the realisation time:

(i) you created in an *associate of yours; or

(ii) an entity covered by subsection (2) (about previous
owners of the underlying asset) created in an associate
of the entity;

a right in respect of the underlying asset; and

(c) immediately before the realisation time, the right is still in
existence and is owned by an associate of yours; and

(d) a decrease in the underlying asset’s *market value is
reasonably attributable to the creating of the right; and

(e) creating the right involved a *CGT event:

(i) whose *capital proceeds are less than the market value
of the right when created (the difference between those
capital proceeds and that market value is called the
**_shortfall on creating the right); and_**

(ii) that is not a CGT event that happens to some part of the
underlying asset but not to the remainder of it; and

(f) the shortfall on creating the right is more than $50,000; and

Value shifting Part 3-95

Direct value shifting by creating right over non-depreciating asset Division 723

##### Section 723-10

(g) the market value of the underlying asset at the realisation
time is less than it would have been if the right no longer
existed at that time (the difference is called the deficit on
**_realisation)._**

Note: If subparagraph (1)(e)(ii) applies, the cost base and reduced cost base
of the underlying asset is apportioned under section 112-30, so there is
no need for this section to apply to the right.

(2) This subsection covers an entity if:

(a) the entity *acquired the underlying asset before you did; and

(b) there has been a roll-over for each *CGT event (if any) as a
result of which an entity (including you) acquired the asset
after the first entity acquired it, and before the realisation
time; and

(c) for each such CGT event (if any), the entity (including you)
that acquired the underlying asset as a result of the event was,
immediately after the event, an *associate of the entity that
last acquired the asset before the event.

(3) The amount by which this section reduces the loss is the lesser of:

(a) the shortfall on creating the right; and

(b) the deficit on realisation.

However, that amount is reduced by each gain that:

(c) is *realised for income tax purposes by a *realisation event
that happens to the right:

(i) before or at the realisation time for the underlying asset;
and

(ii) at a time when the right is owned by an entity that is
your *associate immediately before the realisation time
for the underlying asset; and

(d) is not disregarded.

Note: To work out a gain realised for income tax purposes by a realisation
event that happens to the right, see sections 977-15, 977-35, 977-40
and 977-55. If more than one of those sections applies to the right, see
section 723-50.

(4) For each gain that:

##### Section 723-15

(a) is *realised for income tax purposes by a *realisation event
that happens to the right:

(i) within 4 years after the realisation time for the
underlying asset; and

(ii) at a time when the right is owned by an entity that is
your *associate immediately before the realisation time
for the underlying asset; and

(b) is not disregarded;

the amount worked out under subsection (3) is taken to have been
reduced by the amount of that gain.

Note: This subsection may result in amendment of an assessment for the
income year in which the realisation time happens.

##### 723-15 Reduction in loss from realising non-depreciating asset at the same time as right is created over it

(1) A loss that would, apart from this Division, be *realised for income
tax purposes by a *realisation event is reduced by the amount
worked out under subsections (2) and (3) if:

(a) the event happens to a *CGT asset (the underlying asset) you
own that, at the time of the event (the realisation time):

(i) is not a *depreciating asset; or

(ii) is an item of your *trading stock;

(iii) is a *revenue asset of yours; and

(b) at the realisation time, you create in an *associate of yours a
right in respect of the underlying asset; and

(c) creating the right involves a *CGT event:

(i) whose *capital proceeds are less than the *market value
of the right when created (the difference between those
capital proceeds and that market value is called the
**_shortfall on creating the right); and_**

(ii) that is not a CGT event that happens to some part of the
underlying asset but not to the remainder of it; and

(d) the shortfall on creating the right is more than $50,000; and

Value shifting Part 3-95

Direct value shifting by creating right over non-depreciating asset Division 723

##### Section 723-20

(e) the market value of the underlying asset at the realisation
time is less than it would have been if the right had not been
created (the difference is called the deficit on realisation).

Note: If subparagraph (1)(c)(ii) applies, the cost base and reduced cost base
of the underlying asset is apportioned under section 112-30, so there is
no need for this section to apply to the right.

(2) The amount by which this section reduces the loss is the lesser of:

(a) the shortfall on creating the right; and

(b) the deficit on realisation.

(3) For each gain that:

(a) is *realised for income tax purposes by a *realisation event
that happens to the right:

(i) within 4 years after the realisation time for the
underlying asset; and

(ii) at a time when the right is owned by an entity that is
your *associate immediately before the realisation time
for the underlying asset; and

(b) is not disregarded;

the amount worked out under subsection (2) is taken to have been
reduced by the amount of that gain.

Note 1: To work out a gain realised for income tax purposes by a realisation
event that happens to the right, see sections 977-15, 977-35, 977-40
and 977-55. If more than one of those sections applies to the right, see
section 723-50.

Note 2: This subsection may require amendment of an assessment for the
income year in which the realisation time happens.

##### 723-20 Exceptions

_Conservation covenant over land_

(1) Section 723-10 or 723-15 does not reduce a loss if:

(a) the underlying asset is land; and

(b) the right referred to in paragraph 723-10(1)(b) or
723-15(1)(b) is a *conservation covenant over the land.

**Division 723 Direct value shifting by creating right over non-depreciating asset**

##### Section 723-25

_Right created on death of owner_

(2) Section 723-10 or 723-15 does not reduce a loss if the right
referred to in paragraph 723-10(1)(b) or 723-15(1)(b) is created by:

(a) a will or codicil; or

(b) an order of a court varying or modifying a will or codicil; or

(c) a total or partial intestacy; or

(d) an order of a court varying or modifying the application of
the law about distributing the estate of someone who dies
intestate.

##### 723-25 Realisation event that is only a partial realisation

(1) Section 723-10 or 723-15 applies differently if:

(a) a *realisation event happens to some part of a *CGT asset
(the underlying asset) you own that, at the time of the event:

(i) is not a *depreciating asset; or

(ii) is an item of your *trading stock; or

(iii) is a *revenue asset of yours;

but not to the remainder of the underlying asset; or

(b) a realisation event consists of creating an interest in a CGT
asset (also the underlying asset) you own that, at the time of
the event, is covered by subparagraph (a)(i), (ii) or (iii).

(2) The section applies on the basis that:

(a) the *realisation event happens to the underlying asset; and

(b) the shortfall on creating the right referred to in
paragraph 723-10(1)(e) or 723-15(1)(c); and

(c) the deficit on realisation referred to in
paragraph 723-10(1)(g) or 723-15(1)(e);

are each reduced by multiplying its amount by this fraction:

*Market value of part

*Market value of underlying asset

Value shifting Part 3-95

Direct value shifting by creating right over non-depreciating asset Division 723

##### Section 723-35

**_market value of part means the *market value, at the time of the_**
*realisation event, of the part referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or the
interest referred to in paragraph (1)(b), as appropriate.

**_market value of underlying asset means the *market value,_**
immediately before the *realisation event, of the underlying asset.

##### 723-35 Multiple rights created to take advantage of the $50,000 threshold

(1) Sections 723-10 and 723-15 apply differently if, having regard to
all relevant circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that the sole
or main reason why a right was created as a different right from
one or more other rights created in respect of the same thing was so
that paragraph 723-10(1)(f) or 723-15(1)(d) would not be satisfied
for one or more of the rights mentioned in this subsection.

(2) Those sections:

(a) apply to that thing, in relation to each of the rights mentioned
in subsection (1) of this section, as if paragraphs 723-10(1)(f)
and 723-15(1)(d) were omitted; and

(b) are taken always to have so applied.

##### 723-40 Application to CGT asset that is also trading stock or revenue asset

If a *CGT asset you own is also an item of your *trading stock or a
*revenue asset, this Division applies to the asset once in its
character as a CGT asset and again in its character as trading stock
or a revenue asset.

##### 723-50 Effects if right created over underlying asset is also trading stock or a revenue asset

(1) Subsection 723-10(3) or (4) or 723-15(3) applies differently if the
right created in respect of the underlying asset is also *trading stock
or a *revenue asset at the time of a *realisation event that happens
to the right.

**Division 723 Direct value shifting by creating right over non-depreciating asset**

##### Section 723-105

(2) The gain that is taken into account for the purposes of that
subsection is:

(a) if the right is also *trading stock—worked out under
section 977-35 or 977-40 (about realisation events for trading
stock); or

(b) if the right is also a *revenue asset—the greater of:

(i) the gain worked out under section 977-15 (about
realisation events for CGT assets); and

(ii) the gain worked out under section 977-55 (about
realisation events for revenue assets).

##### 723-105 Reduced cost base of interest reduced when interest realised at a loss

(1) The *reduced cost base of a *primary equity interest, *secondary
equity interest, or *indirect primary equity interest, in a company or
trust is reduced just before a *realisation event that is a *CGT event
happens to the interest if:

(a) apart from this Division, a loss would be *realised for income
tax purposes by the CGT event; and

(b) apart from this Division, a loss would have been *realised for
income tax purposes by a realisation event if the event had
happened, just before the CGT event, to a *CGT asset (the
**_underlying asset) that the company or trust then owned and_**
that:

(i) was not then a *depreciating asset; or

(ii) was then an item of *trading stock of the company or
trust; or

(iii) was then a *revenue asset of the company or trust; and

(c) the loss referred to in paragraph (b) would have been reduced
under Subdivision 723-A by an amount (the underlying asset
**_loss reduction); and_**

(d) for the entity (the transferor) that owned the interest just
before the CGT event, the interest was a *direct roll-over
replacement or *indirect roll-over replacement for the
underlying asset.

(2) If the interest was a *direct roll-over replacement, its *reduced cost
base is reduced by the amount worked out using this formula,
unless that amount does not appropriately reflect the matters
referred to in subsection (4):


RCB of interest

 Underlying asset loss reduction

Total of RCBs of direct

roll-over replacements

(3) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (2):

**_RCB of interest means the interest’s *reduced cost base when the_**
transferor *acquired it.

**_total of RCBs of direct roll-over replacements means the total of_**
the *reduced cost bases of all *direct roll-over replacements for the
underlying asset when the transferor *acquired them.

(4) If:

(a) the interest was an *indirect roll-over replacement; or

(b) the amount worked out under subsection (2) does not
appropriately reflect the matters referred to in this subsection;

the interest’s *reduced cost base is reduced by an amount that is
appropriate having regard to these matters:

(c) the underlying asset loss reduction; and

(d) the quantum of the interest relative to all *direct roll-over
replacements and indirect roll-over replacements that the
transferor owns or has previously owned.

**Division 723 Direct value shifting by creating right over non-depreciating asset**

##### Section 723-110

##### 723-110 Direct and indirect roll-over replacement for underlying asset

(1) For an entity (the transferor) that owns a *CGT asset, the CGT
asset is a direct roll-over replacement for something (the
**_underlying asset) that another entity owns if, and only if:_**

(a) a *CGT event happened to the underlying asset while the
transferor owned it; and

(b) the other entity *acquired the underlying asset as a result of
that CGT event; and

(c) there was a *replacement-asset roll-over for the CGT event;
and

(d) the transferor received the CGT asset (or CGT assets
including it) in respect of the CGT event as the replacement
asset (or the replacement assets).

(2) For an entity (the transferor) that owns a *CGT asset, the CGT
asset is an indirect roll-over replacement for something (the
**_underlying asset) that another entity owns if, and only if:_**

(a) a *CGT event happened to another CGT asset at a time when
the transferor owned it and the other entity already owned the
underlying asset; and

(b) for the transferor, the other CGT asset was at that time:

(i) a *direct roll-over replacement for the underlying asset;
or

(ii) an indirect roll-over replacement for the underlying
asset because of any other application or applications of
this subsection; and

(c) there was a *replacement-asset roll-over for the CGT event;
and

(d) the transferor received the first CGT asset (or CGT assets
including it) in respect of the CGT event as the replacement
asset (or the replacement assets).

If, under a scheme, value is shifted from equity or loan interests in
a company or trust to other equity or loan interests in the same
company or trust (including interests issued at a discount), this
Division:

(a) adjusts the value of those interests for income tax
purposes to take account of material changes in
market value that are attributable to the value shift;
and

(b) treats the value shift as a partial realisation to the
extent that value is shifted between interests held
by different owners, and in some other cases.

to other equity or loan interests in the same entity; and

(b) to prevent inappropriate gains from arising on the realisation
of equity or loan interests in the same entity to which the
value has been shifted;

so far as those interests are owned by entities involved in the value
shift.

(2) This is done by:

(a) adjusting the value of those interests for income tax purposes
to take account of changes in *market value that are
attributable to the value shift; and

##### Section 725-50

(ii) in the case of interests in their character as CGT
assets—from post-CGT assets to pre-CGT assets; or

(iii) between interests of different characters.

##### 725-50 When a direct value shift has consequences under this Division

A *direct value shift under a *scheme involving *equity or loan
interests in an entity (the target entity) has consequences for you
under this Division if, and only if:

(a) the target entity is a company or trust at some time during the
*scheme period; and

(b) section 725-55 (Controlling entity test) is satisfied; and

(c) section 725-65 (Cause of the value shift) is satisfied; and

(d) you are an *affected owner of a *down interest, or an
*affected owner of an *up interest, or both; and

(e) neither of sections 725-90 and 725-95 (about direct value
shifts that are reversed) applies.

Note: For a down interest of which you are an affected owner, the direct
value shift has consequences under this Division only if
section 725-70 (about material decrease in market value) is satisfied.

##### 725-55 Controlling entity test

An entity (the controller) must *control (for value shifting
purposes) the target entity at some time during the period starting
when the *scheme is entered into and ending when it has been
carried out. (That period is the scheme period.)

For the concept of control (for value shifting purposes),
see sections 727-355 to 727-375.

##### 725-65 Cause of the value shift

(1) It must be the case that one or more of the following:

(a) the target entity;

(b) the controller;

**Part 3-95 Value shifting**
**Division 725 Direct value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts**

##### Section 725-65

(c) an entity that was an *associate of the controller at some time
during or after the *scheme period;

(d) an *active participant in the *scheme;

(either alone or together with one or more other entities) did under
the scheme the one or more things:

(e) to which the decrease in the *market value of the *down
interests is reasonably attributable; and

(f) to which the increase in the market value of the *up interests,
or the issue of up interests at a *discount, is reasonably
attributable, or that is or include the issue of up interests at a
*discount.

_Active participants (if target entity is closely held)_

(2) An entity (the first entity) is an active participant in the *scheme if,
and only if:

(a) at some time during the *scheme period, the target entity has
fewer than 300 members (in the case of a company) or fewer
than 300 beneficiaries (in the case of a trust); and

(b) the first entity has actively participated in, or directly
facilitated, the entering into or carrying out of the *scheme
(whether or not it did so at the direction of some other
entity); and

(c) the first entity:

(i) owns a *down interest at the *decrease time; or

(ii) owns an *up interest at the *increase time or has an up
interest issued to it at a *discount because of the *direct
value shift.

_When an entity has 300 or more members or beneficiaries_

(3) Section 124-810 (under which certain companies and trusts are not
regarded as having 300 or more members or beneficiaries) also
applies for the purposes of this Division.

(4) In addition, this Division applies to a *non-fixed trust as if it did
not have 300 or more beneficiaries.

Value shifting Part 3-95

Direct value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts Division 725

##### Section 725-70

##### 725-70 Consequences for down interest only if there is a material decrease in its market value

(1) For a *down interest of which you are an *affected owner, the
*direct value shift has consequences under this Division only if the
sum of the decreases in the *market value of all down interests
because of direct value shifts under the same *scheme as the direct
value shift is at least $150,000.

Note: In working out the sum of the decreases in market value of all down
interests, it will be necessary to include decreases not only in your
down interests, but also in those of other affected owners and of
entities that are not affected owners.

(2) However, if, having regard to all relevant circumstances, it is
reasonable to conclude that the sole or main reason why a *direct
value shift happened under a different scheme from one or more
other direct value shifts was so that subsection (1) would not be
satisfied for one or more of the direct value shifts mentioned in this
subsection, subsection (1) does not apply (and is taken never to
have applied) to any of the direct value shifts.

##### 725-80 Who is an affected owner of a down interest?

An entity is an affected owner of a *down interest if, and only if,
the entity owns the down interest at the *decrease time and at least
one of these paragraphs is satisfied:

(a) the entity is the controller;

(b) the entity was an *associate of the controller at some time
during or after the *scheme period;

(c) the entity is an *active participant in the *scheme.

##### 725-85 Who is an affected owner of an up interest?

An entity is an affected owner of an *up interest if, and only if:

(a) there is at least one *affected owner of *down interests; and

##### Section 725-90

(b) the entity owns the up interest at the *increase time, or the
interest is an up interest because it was issued to the entity at
a *discount;

and at least one of these paragraphs is satisfied:

(c) the entity is the controller;

(d) the entity was an *associate of the controller at some time
during or after the *scheme period;

(e) at some time during or after the scheme period, the entity was
an associate of an entity that is an affected owner of down
interests because it was an associate of the controller at some
time during or after that period;

(f) the entity is an *active participant in the *scheme.

##### 725-90 Direct value shift that will be reversed

(1) The *direct value shift does not have consequences for you under
this Division if:

(a) the one or more things referred to in paragraph 725-145(1)(b)
brought about a state of affairs, but for which the direct value
shift would not have happened; and

(b) as at the time referred to in that paragraph, it is more likely
than not that, because of the *scheme, that state of affairs will
cease to exist within 4 years after that time.

Example: Under a scheme, the voting rights attached to a class of shares in a
company are changed. As a result, the market value of shares in that
class decreases, and the market value of other classes of shares in the
company increases. The company’s constitution provides that the
change is to last for only 3 years.

(2) However, this section stops applying if the state of affairs referred
to in paragraph (1)(a) still exists:

(a) at the end of those 4 years; or

(b) when a *realisation event happens to *down interests or *up
interests of which you are, or any other entity is, an *affected
owner;

whichever happens sooner.

(3) If this section stops applying, it is taken never to have applied to
the *direct value shift.

Note: This may result in an assessment for an earlier income year having to
be amended to give effect to the consequences that the direct value
shift would have had for you under this Division if this section hadn’t
applied.

##### 725-95 Direct value shift resulting from reversal

(1) A *direct value shift does not have consequences for any entity
under this Division if:

(a) section 725-90 applies, and the state of affairs referred to in
paragraph 725-90(1)(a) ceases to exist; and

(b) the direct value shift would not have happened but for that
state of affairs ceasing to exist.

##### 725-145 When there is a direct value shift

(1) There is a direct value shift under a *scheme involving *equity or
loan interests in an entity (the target entity) if:

(a) there is a decrease in the *market value of one or more equity
or loan interests in the target entity; and

(b) the decrease is reasonably attributable to one or more things
done under the scheme, and occurs at or after the time when
that thing, or the first of those things, is done; and

**Division 725 Direct value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts**

##### Section 725-150

(c) either or both of subsections (2) and (3) are satisfied.

Examples of something done under a scheme are issuing new
shares at a *discount, buying back shares or changing the voting
rights attached to shares.

(2) One or more *equity or loan interests in the target entity must be
issued at a *discount. The issue must be, or must be reasonably
attributable to, the thing, or one or more of the things, referred to in
paragraph (1)(b). It must also occur at or after the time referred to
in that paragraph.

Example: A company runs a family business. There are 2 shares originally
issued for $2 each. They are owned by husband and wife. The market
value of the shares is much greater (represented by the value of the
assets of the company less its liabilities). The company issues one
more share for $2 to their son.

Caution is needed in such a situation. The example would result in a
large CGT liability for the husband and wife under this Division,
because they have shifted 1/3 of the value of their own shares to their
son. No such liability would arise if the share had been issued for its
market value.

(3) Or, there must be an increase in the *market value of one or more
*equity or loan interests in the target entity. The increase must be
reasonably attributable to the thing, or to one or more of the things,
referred to in paragraph (1)(b). It must also occur at or after the
time referred to in that paragraph.

##### 725-150 Issue of equity or loan interests at a discount

(1) An *equity or loan interest is issued at a discount if, and only if,
the *market value of the interest when issued exceeds the amount
of the payment that the issuing entity receives. The excess is the
amount of the discount.

(2) The payment that the issuing entity receives can include property.
If it does, use the *market value of the property in working out the
amount of the payment.

(a) a *primary equity interest is issued as mentioned in
subsection 130-20(1) (about bonus equities issued in relation
to original equities); and

(b) subsection 130-20(3) does not apply (about bonus equities
that are a dividend or otherwise assessable income);

subsection (1) of this section applies to the interest as if the amount
of the payment that the issuing entity receives were equal to the
*cost base of the interest when issued (as worked out under
section 130-20).

(4) If:

(a) a *primary equity interest is issued as mentioned in
subsection 6BA(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
(about bonus shares issued in relation to original shares); and

(b) subsection 6BA(2) of that Act applies (about bonus shares
that are a dividend);

subsection (1) of this section applies to the interest as if the amount
of the payment that the issuing entity receives were equal to the
consideration worked out under subsection 6BA(2) of that Act.

(5) If both of subsections (3) and (4) apply to the issue of the same
*primary equity interest, subsection (1) of this section applies to the
interest as if the amount of the payment that the issuing entity
receives were equal to the greater of the amounts worked out under
subsections (3) and (4).

_Application of subsections (3), (4) and (5)_

(6) Subsection (3) does not apply if, for the income year in which the
interest is issued, the issuing entity is a public trading trust within
the meaning of section 102R of the Income Tax Assessment Act
_1936._

##### Section 725-155

(7) Subsections (3), (4) and (5) have effect only for the purposes of
working out whether a *direct value shift has happened and, if so,
its consequences (if any) under this Division.

##### 725-155 Meaning of down interests , decrease time , up interests and increase time

(1) An *equity or loan interest in the target entity is a down interest if
a decrease in its *market value is reasonably attributable to the one
or more things referred to in paragraph 725-145(1)(b), and occurs
at or after the time referred to in that paragraph. The time when the
decrease happens is called the decrease time for that interest.

(2) An *equity or loan interest in the target entity is an up interest if
subsection 725-145(2) or (3) is satisfied for the interest. The time
when the interest is issued at a *discount, or the increase in *market
value happens, is called the increase time for that interest.

##### 725-160 What is the nature of a direct value shift?

(1) The *direct value shift has 2 aspects.

(2) Overall, it consists of:

(a) the decreases in *market value of the down interests; and

(b) the issue at a *discount of the up interests covered by
subsection 725-145(2); and

(c) the increases in market value of the up interests covered by
subsection 725-145(3).

(3) This Division also proceeds on the basis that the *direct value shift
is from each of the *down interests to each of the *up interests.

##### 725-165 If market value decrease or increase is only partly attributable to the scheme

If it is reasonable to conclude that an increase or decrease in
*market value, or the issuing of an *equity or loan interest at a
*discount, is only partly caused by the doing of the one or more

#### Subdivision 725-C—Consequences of a direct value shift

**General**

725-205 Consequences depend on character of down interests and up interests

725-225 Issue of bonus shares or units

725-230 Off-market buy-backs

#### General

##### 725-205 Consequences depend on character of down interests and up interests

(1) The consequences for you of the *direct value shift depend on the
character of the *down interests and *up interests of which you are
an *affected owner.

(2) There are consequences for all your *down interests and *up
interests in their character as *CGT assets. However, some of them
may also be *trading stock or *revenue assets. There are additional
consequences for those interests in their character as trading stock
or revenue assets.

Note: For example, you may own a down interest that is a CGT asset and a
revenue asset.

Sections 725-240 to 725-255 set out the consequences for you of a
shift in value from that interest in its character as a CGT asset. The
cost base of the asset will be decreased, which will affect the
calculation of a capital gain when a CGT event happens to the interest.

Section 725-320 sets out the consequences for you of a shift in value
from that interest in its character as a revenue asset. The adjustment

made under that section will affect the calculation of any profit on the
sale of the interest.

Any overlap between the capital gain and the profit realised on the
sale of the interest is then dealt with under section 118-20.

In some instances, the direct value shift may result in a taxing event
generating a gain for you in the income year in which the shift
happens. That gain will be both a capital gain (because the down
interest can be characterised as a CGT asset) and an increase in your
assessable income (because the down interest can be characterised as a
revenue asset). Again, any overlap is dealt with under section 118-20.

##### 725-210 Consequences for down interests depend on pre-shift gains and losses

(1) The consequences for a *down interest also depend on whether it
has a *pre-shift gain or a *pre-shift loss.

(2) It has a pre-shift **_gain if, immediately before the *decrease time, its_**
*market value was greater than its *adjustable value.

(3) It has a pre-shift **_loss if, immediately before the *decrease time, its_**
*market value was equal to or less than its *adjustable value.

#### Special cases

##### 725-220 Neutral direct value shifts

(1) The consequences are different if the total decrease in *market
value of your *down interests is equal to the sum of:

(a) the total increase in market value of your *up interests; and

(b) the total *discounts given to you on the issue of your up
interests.

(2) In that case, this Subdivision and Subdivisions 725-D to 725-F
apply to you as if the *direct value shift:

(a) consisted only of:

(i) the decreases in *market value of your *down interests;

(a) there are one or more *taxing events generating a gain for
*down interests of which you are an affected owner (see
subsection (2));

(b) the *cost base and *reduced cost base of down interests of
which you are an *affected owner are reduced (see
subsection (3));

(c) the cost base and reduced cost base of *up interests of which
you are an affected owner are uplifted (see subsection (4)).

Note: If there is a taxing event generating a gain, CGT event K8 happens.
See section 104-250.

_Taxing event generating a gain_

(2) To work out:

(a) whether under the table in section 725-245 there is a *taxing
event generating a gain for you on a *down interest; and

(b) if so, the amount of the gain;

assume that the adjustable value from time to time of that or any
other *equity or loan interest in the *target entity is its *cost base.

Note: For example, for that purpose the question whether the interest has a
pre-shift gain or a pre-shift loss is determined on the basis that the
interest’s adjustable value is its cost base.

_Reduction or uplift of cost base and reduced cost base_

(3) The *cost base and the *reduced cost base of a *down interest are
reduced at the *decrease time to the extent that section 725-250
provides for the *adjustable value of the interest to be reduced.

(4) The *cost base and the *reduced cost base of an *up interest are
uplifted at the *increase time to the extent that section 725-250
provides for the *adjustable value of the interest to be uplifted.

(5) However, the *cost base or *reduced cost base is uplifted only to
the extent that the amount of the uplift is still reflected in the
*market value of the interest when a later *CGT event happens to
the interest.

assume that:

before it was issued was its cost base or reduced cost base, as
appropriate, when it was issued.

Note: For example, for that purpose the question whether the interest has a

give rise to a taxing event generating a gain for you on each of

Value shifting Part 3-95

Direct value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts Division 725

##### Section 725-255

**Consequences of the direct value shift for adjustable values of CGT assets**


**Item** **To the extent that the**
**direct value shift is**
**from:**

10 *down interests owned
by entities that are not
*affected owners


**To:** **The decrease or**
**uplift is worked out**
**under:**


*up interests owned by
_you_


(there are no
decreases or uplifts)


_Reducing uplift to prevent double increase in cost base etc._

(3) However, if, apart from paragraph (2)(b), an amount is included in
the *cost base or *reduced cost base of an *up interest as a result of
the *scheme under which the *direct value shift happens, the uplift
in the *adjustable value of the interest under that paragraph is
reduced by that amount.

##### 725-255 Multiple CGT consequences for the same down interest or up interest

(1) A *down interest or *up interest of which you are an *affected
owner may be covered by 2 or more items in the table in
subsection 725-250(2).

(2) If the *cost base or *reduced cost base of the same *down interest
or *up interest is decreased or uplifted under 2 or more items, it is
decreased or uplifted by the total of the amounts worked out under
those items.

Note: If subsection 725-250(3) is relevant, it will affect all the uplifts
worked out under all those items.

(3) If for a particular *down interest there is a *taxing event generating
a gain under an item in the table in section 725-245, that taxing
event is in addition to:

(a) each taxing event generating a gain for that interest under any
other item in that table; and

(b) each decrease in the *cost base or *reduced cost base of the
interest under an item in the table in subsection 725-250(2).

##### 725-310 Consequences for down interest or up interest as trading stock

(1) The consequences of the *direct value shift for your *trading stock
are of one or more of these 3 kinds:

(a) the *adjustable values of *down interests of which you are an
*affected owner are reduced (see subsection (2));

(b) the adjustable values of *up interests of which you are an
affected owner are uplifted (see subsection (3));

(c) there are one or more *taxing events generating a gain for
down interests of which you are an affected owner (see
subsection (5)).

_Effect of reduction or uplift of adjustable value_

(2) If the *adjustable value of a *down interest that is your *trading
stock is reduced under section 725-335, you are treated as if:

(a) *immediately before the *decrease time, you had sold the
interest to someone else (at *arm’s length and in the ordinary
course of business) for its *adjustable value immediately
before the decrease time; and

(b) immediately after the decrease time, you had bought the
interest back for the reduced adjustable value.

##### Section 725-315

(3) If the *adjustable value of an *up interest that is your *trading stock
is uplifted under section 725-335, you are treated as if:

(a) *immediately before the *increase time, you had sold the
interest to someone else (at *arm’s length and in the ordinary
course of business) for its *adjustable value immediately
before the increase time; and

(b) immediately after the increase time, you had bought the
interest back for the uplifted adjustable value.

(4) However, the increase in the cost of an *up interest because of
paragraph (3)(b) is taken into account from time to time only to the
extent that the amount of the increase is still reflected in the
*market value of the interest.

Note: The situations where the increase in cost would be taken into account
include:

-  in working out your deductions for the cost of trading stock
acquired during the income year in which the increase time
happens; and

-  the end of an income year if the interest’s closing value as
trading stock is worked out on the basis of its cost; and

-  the start of the income year in which the interest is disposed of, if
that happens in a later income year and the interest’s closing
value as trading stock at the end of the previous income year was
worked out on the basis of its cost.

If the interest stops being trading stock, section 70-110 treats you as
having disposed of it.

_Taxing event generating a gain_

(5) For each *taxing event generating a gain under an item in the table
in subsection 725-335(3), the gain is included in your assessable
income for the income year in which the *decrease time happens.

(a) if the interest has been trading stock of yours ever since the
start of the income year in which that time occurs—its *value
as trading stock at the start of the income year; or

(b) otherwise—its cost.

Note 1: If an interest has been affected by an earlier direct value shift during
the same income year, it will be treated as having already been sold
and repurchased (because of an earlier application of
section 725-310). As a result, the cost on repurchase becomes its
adjustable value immediately before the decrease time or increase
time for the later direct value shift.

Note 2: The adjustable value of an interest that is an up interest because it was
issued at a discount is worked out under paragraph (b).

##### 725-320 Consequences for down interest or up interest as a revenue asset

(1) The consequences of the *direct value shift for your *revenue assets
are of one or more of these 3 kinds:

(a) the *adjustable values of *down interests of which you are an
*affected owner are reduced (see subsection (2));

(b) the adjustable values of *up interests of which you are an
affected owner are uplifted (see subsection (3));

(c) one or more *taxing events generating a gain for down
interests of which you are an affected owner (see
subsection (5)).

_Effect of reduction or uplift of adjustable value_

(2) If the *adjustable value of a *down interest that is your *revenue
asset is decreased under section 725-335, you are treated as if:

(a) *immediately before the *decrease time, you had sold the
interest to someone else for its *adjustable value immediately
before the decrease time; and

(b) immediately afterwards, you had bought the interest back for
the reduced adjustable value; and

##### Section 725-325

(c) from the time when you bought it back, the interest continued
to be a revenue asset, for the same reasons as it was a
revenue asset before you sold it.

(3) If the *adjustable value of an *up interest that is your *revenue asset
is uplifted under section 725-335, you are treated as if:

(a) *immediately before the *increase time, you had sold the
interest to someone else for its *adjustable value immediately
before the increase time; and

(b) immediately afterwards, you had bought the interest back for
the uplifted adjustable value; and

(c) from the time when you bought it back, the interest continued
to be a revenue asset, for the same reasons as it was a
revenue asset before you sold it.

(4) However, the uplift in *adjustable value is taken into account only
to the extent that the amount of the uplift is still reflected in the
*market value of the interest when it is disposed of or otherwise
realised.

_Taxing event generating a gain_

(5) For each *taxing event generating a gain under an item in the table
in subsection 725-335(3), the gain is included in your assessable
income for the income year in which the *decrease time happens.

##### 725-325  Adjustable value of revenue asset

(1) If a *down interest is your *revenue asset, its adjustable value
immediately before the *decrease time is the total of the amounts
that would be subtracted from the gross disposal proceeds in
calculating any profit or loss on disposal of the interest if you
disposed of it immediately before the decrease time.

(2) If an *up interest is your *revenue asset and it increases in *market
value because of the *direct value shift, its adjustable value
immediately before the *increase time is the total of the amounts
that would be subtracted from the gross disposal proceeds in

calculating any profit or loss on disposal of the interest if you
disposed of it immediately before the increase time.

(3) If an *up interest is your *revenue asset and it is issued at a
*discount, it is taken to have an adjustable value immediately
before it is issued equal to the consideration paid or given by you
for the interest.

Note: If an interest has been affected by an earlier direct value shift during
the same income year, it will be treated as having already been sold
and repurchased (because of an earlier application of
section 725-320). As a result, the cost on repurchase becomes its
adjustable value immediately before the decrease time or increase
time for the later direct value shift.

##### 725-335 How to work out those consequences

(1) This section sets out the consequences of the *direct value shift for
a *down interest or *up interest as *trading stock or a *revenue
asset.

(2) If you have both *trading stock and *revenue assets, items 1 and 2
of the table in subsection (3) can apply once to the trading stock
and again to the revenue assets. The other items apply (if at all) to
the trading stock and revenue assets together.

_Decreases and uplifts in adjustable value_

(3) To the extent that the *direct value shift is from *down interests
specified in an item in the table to *up interests specified in that
item:

(a) the *adjustable value of each of those down interests is
decreased by the amount worked out under the section (if
any) specified for the down interests in the last column of
that item; and

(b) the adjustable value of each of those *up interests is uplifted
by the amount worked out under the section (if any) specified
for the up interests in that column.

_Method statement_

Step 1. If the *market value of the *up interest increases because
of the direct value shift, group together all *up interests of
the kind referred to in the relevant item that sustained the
same increase in market value as the up interest because

If the up interest is issued at a discount, group together all
up interests of the kind referred to in the relevant item
that are issued at a discount of the same amount as the up
interest because of the direct value shift.

Step 2. The value shifted to that group of *up interests from the
*down interests referred to in the relevant item is the
amount worked out using the formula:

Sum of the decreases
Sum of the group increases

However, it does so only for interests that are owned by entities
involved in the value shift.

or extent of an indirect value shift can be fully determined

##### 727-5 What is an indirect value shift?

(1) An indirect value shift arises when there is a net shift of value from
one entity to another.

Example: Company A transfers property to company B in return for a cash
payment. If the market value of the property is $180 million but the
cash payment is only $50 million, there is a net shift of value from
company A to company B of $130 million.

(2) It is called indirect because the transaction will have the indirect
effect of shifting value from equity or loan interests in the losing
entity to equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.

This is because the net shift in value between the entities will
usually decrease the market value of interests in the losing entity
and increase the market value of interests in the gaining entity.

Example: Assume that company C owns all the shares in company A and
company D owns all the shares in company B. The net shift of value
from company A to company B will reduce the value of company C’s
shares in company A and increase the value of company D’s shares in
company B.

(3) It will also produce corresponding effects further up a chain of
entities.

Example: Assume that company E owns all the shares in company C and
company D. The net shift of value from company A to company B
will also reduce the value of company E’s shares in company C and
increase the value of its shares in company D.

|---|---|
|A|B|


(4) This Division is not concerned with the tax treatment of the net
shift in value between the entities at the bottom of the chains.
Instead, it deals with the effects on the market value of interests
(both direct and indirect) in those entities.

(5) An indirect value shift distorts the relationship between the market
value of an equity or loan interest and its value for income tax
purposes. When the interest is realised, this can produce an

inappropriate loss for income tax purposes, or an inappropriate
gain.

Example: If company E sold its shares in company C, the indirect value shift
could (apart from this Division) result in a loss for income tax
purposes. Company E could defer the corresponding gain on its shares
in company D by not selling these.

##### 727-10 How does this Division deal with indirect value shifts?

(1) To prevent an inappropriate loss or gain from arising on realisation
of an interest, this Division reduces the amount of the loss or gain
(realisation time method). However, a choice can be made to adjust
the interest’s value for income tax purposes in a way that takes
account of the indirect value shift (adjustable value method).

(2) This Division does not create taxing events giving rise to gains or
losses.

##### 727-15 When does an indirect value shift have consequences under this Division?

(1) Indirect value shift is defined very broadly, but the application of
this Division is limited in various ways.

(2) The losing entity must be a company or trust (except a
superannuation entity). However, the gaining entity can be any
kind of entity, including an individual.

(3) This Division does not apply if entities deal with each other at
arm’s length, or provide economic benefits in return for full market
value.

(4) The losing entity and the gaining entity must be connected by
having had the same ultimate controller. In the case of closely held
entities, they may instead be connected by having had a high level
of common ownership.

(5) The only interests affected are those owned by entities involved in
the indirect value shift or by their associates.

##### Section 727-25

(6) There are a range of exclusions, such as:

(a) exclusions for minor indirect value shifts; and

(b) a series of rules designed to provide safe harbour treatment
for common transactions relating to services; and

(c) anti-overlap provisions to prevent double-counting.

(7) Rules of thumb are included to make it easier to determine the
market value of some kinds of economic benefits.

(8) To reduce compliance costs for:

(a) *small business entities; and

(b) entities that meet the CGT small business net asset threshold
($6 million);

interests owned by those entities are not affected by this Division.

##### 727-25 Effect of this Division on realisations at a loss that occur before the nature or extent of an indirect value shift can be fully determined

(1) To determine whether a scheme gives rise to an indirect value shift,
it must be possible to identify all the economic benefits under the
scheme, and the providers and recipients of those benefits.

(2) Before then, interests that might be affected by the scheme may be
realised at a loss. Subdivision 727-K contains special rules that
apply if that happens.

**Division 727 Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and**
arising from non-arm’s length dealings

##### Section 727-95

##### 727-95 Main object

The main object of this Division is:

(a) to prevent inappropriate losses from arising on the realisation
of direct or indirect equity or loan interests in an entity from
which there has been a net shift of value because of a dealing
that is not at *arm’s length; and

(b) to prevent inappropriate gains from arising on the realisation
of *direct equity interests or *indirect equity interests in the
entity to which that value has been shifted;

in cases where the 2 entities are related as set out in this Division.

##### 727-100 When an indirect value shift has consequences under this Division

An *indirect value shift (see Subdivision 727-B) has consequences
under this Division if, and only if:

(a) the *losing entity is at the time of the indirect value shift a
company or trust (except one listed in section 727-125 (about
superannuation entities)); and

(b) in relation to either or both of the following:

(i) the losing entity *providing one or more economic
benefits to the gaining entity *in connection with the
*scheme from which the indirect value shift results;

(ii) the gaining entity providing one or more economic
benefits to the losing entity in connection with the
scheme;

the 2 entities are not dealing with each other at *arm’s length;
and

(c) either or both of sections 727-105 and 727-110 are satisfied;
and

(d) no exclusion in Subdivision 727-C applies.

Note 1: The consequences for direct and indirect interests in the losing entity
or in the gaining entity are set out in Subdivision 727-F. If those
consequences are to be worked out using the realisation time method

##### Section 727-105

(under Subdivision 727-G), there are further exclusions for certain
95% services indirect value shifts: see section 727-700.

Note 2: An indirect value shift does not have consequences for interests in the
losing entity or gaining entity owned immediately before the IVS time
by an entity that:

-  is a small business entity for each income year that includes any
of the IVS period; or

-  would satisfy the maximum net asset value test in section 152-15
throughout the IVS period.

See subsection 727-470(2).

##### 727-105 Ultimate controller test

It must be the case that, at some time during the *IVS period:

(a) the *losing entity and the *gaining entity have the same
*ultimate controller; or

(b) the ultimate controller of the losing entity is the same entity
that was the ultimate controller of the gaining entity at a
different time during that period; or

(c) the gaining entity is the ultimate controller of the losing
entity; or

(d) the losing entity is the ultimate controller of the gaining
entity.

For the concept of IVS period, see section 727-150.

For the concept of ultimate controller, see section 727-350.

##### 727-110 Common-ownership nexus test (if both losing and gaining entities are closely held)

(1) Or, it must be the case that:

(a) at some time during the *IVS period, neither the *losing
entity nor the *gaining entity has 300 or more members (in
the case of a company) or 300 or more beneficiaries (in the
case of a trust); and

(b) the losing entity and the gaining entity have a
*common-ownership nexus within the IVS period.

the earliest time (either when the scheme is entered into or later)
when it is reasonable to conclude that:

(a) all the economic benefits that have been, are being, or are to
be, *provided *in connection with the scheme can be
identified; and

(b) for each of those economic benefits:

(i) the entity that has provided, is providing, or is to
provide, the economic benefit can be identified; and

(ii) the entity to which the economic benefit has been, is
being, or is to be, provided can be identified; and

(iii) if the economic benefit is to be provided—those entities
are in existence, and the providing of the economic
benefit is not contingent; and

(c) there are no other economic benefits that are to be provided
in connection with the scheme if some contingency is met.

That time is called the IVS time for the scheme.

Note: In most cases, the IVS time will be at or soon after the scheme is
entered into. However, if:

-  direct or indirect interests in a company or trust are realised at a
loss when the IVS time for the scheme has not yet happened
(even if it never happens); and

-  the company or trust has provided, is providing, is to provide, or
might provide, economic benefits in connection with the scheme;

there may be consequences for those interests similar to those of an
indirect value shift resulting from the scheme. See Subdivision 727-K.

(3) The *scheme results in an indirect value shift from one entity (the
**_losing entity) to another entity (the gaining entity) if the total_**
*market value of the one or more economic benefits (the greater
**_benefits) that the losing entity has *provided, is providing, or is to_**
provide, to the gaining entity *in connection with the scheme

(lesser benefits) that the gaining entity has provided, is
providing, or is to provide, to the losing entity in connection
with the scheme; or

##### Section 727-155

(b) if there are no economic benefits covered by paragraph (a)—
nil.

That excess is the amount of the indirect value shift.

(4) The *market value of an economic benefit is to be determined as at
the earliest time when it is reasonable to conclude that:

(a) the economic benefit can be identified; and

(b) paragraph (2)(b) is satisfied for that benefit.

For more rules affecting how the market value of an economic benefit is
determined, see Subdivision 727-D.

(5) Neither the *losing entity nor the *gaining entity needs to be a party
to the *scheme. A benefit can be provided by act or omission.

(6) The indirect value shift happens at the *IVS time.

(7) The IVS period for a *scheme starts immediately before the
scheme is entered into and ends at the *IVS time.

(8) A contingency that is artificial, or is virtually certain to be met, is
treated under this Division as if it had been met.

##### 727-155 Providing economic benefits

_Examples_

(1) These are some examples of an entity providing an economic
benefit to another entity:

(a) the first entity pays an amount to the other entity (in this case
the *market value of the benefit is the amount of the
payment);

(b) the first entity provides an asset or services to the other
entity;

(c) the first entity does something that creates an asset in the
hands of the other entity (for example, a company issues
shares to its members);

(d) the first entity incurs a liability to the other entity, or
increases a liability it already owes to the other entity;

(e) the first entity terminates all or part of a liability owed by the
other entity;

(f) the first entity does something that increases the market value
of an asset that the other entity holds.

(2) These examples are not intended to limit the meaning of providing
an economic benefit.

_Things treated as economic benefits_

(3) This Division applies as if the ending of:

(a) a *primary equity interest or *secondary equity interest in an
entity; or

(b) a right that the owner of a *primary equity interest or
*secondary equity interest in an entity has because of owning
the interest;

were an economic benefit that the owner of the interest provides to
that entity.

##### 727-160 When an economic benefit is provided in connection with a scheme

(1) An economic benefit has been, is being, is to be, or might be,
*provided by an entity to another entity in connection with a
*scheme if, and only if:

(a) the benefit has been, is being, is to be, or might be, provided
under the scheme; or

(b) the providing of the benefit is reasonably attributable to:

(i) something that has been, is being, is to be, or might be,
done or omitted under the scheme (whether before, at
the time of, or after, the providing of the benefit) by an
entity that is either of those entities or a third entity; or

(ii) 2 or more such things.

(2) An entity referred to in paragraph (1)(b) need not be a party to the
*scheme. A benefit can be provided by act or omission.

##### Section 727-165

##### 727-165 Preventing double-counting of economic benefits

_Rights to have economic benefits provided_

(1) If an economic benefit that has been, is being, is to be, or might be,
*provided as mentioned in subsection 727-150(3) or 727-855(1)
consists of a right to have economic benefits provided, that
subsection applies to the right but does not also apply to those
economic benefits.

Example: Acme Ltd enters into an agreement with Paragon Pty Ltd under which
Acme is to provide services to Paragon over a 5 year period in return
for payments.

Paragon’s rights under the agreement are economic benefits that
Acme provides to Paragon when the agreement is made. The services
are economic benefits that Acme is to provide to Paragon.

Because of this subsection, the market value of the rights is taken into
account in working out whether there has been an indirect value shift,
but the market value of the services is not.

_Effect of an economic benefit on interests in the entity to which it is_
_provided_

(2) If an economic benefit has been, is being, or is to be, *provided to
an entity, then, for the purposes of subsection 727-150(3) or
727-855(1), disregard an economic benefit to the extent that:

(a) it consists of an increase in the *market value of:

(i) an *equity or loan interest in the entity; or

(ii) an *indirect equity or loan interest in the entity; and

(b) the increase is reasonably attributable to the first-mentioned
benefit.

**Part 3-95 Value shifting**
**Division 727 Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and**
arising from non-arm’s length dealings

##### Section 727-215

#### General

##### 727-215 Amount does not exceed $50,000

(1) An *indirect value shift does not have consequences under this
Division if the amount of it does not exceed $50,000.

(2) However, subsection (1) does not apply to an *indirect value shift
(and is taken never to have applied to it) if:

(a) before, at the same time as, or after it, another indirect value
shift happens for which the same entity is the losing entity as
for the first indirect value shift; and

(b) having regard to all relevant circumstances, it is reasonable to
conclude that the sole or main reason why one of the indirect
value shifts happened under a different *scheme from the
other was so that its amount would not exceed $50,000.

##### 727-220 Disposal of asset at cost, or at undervalue if full value is not reflected in adjustable values of equity or loan interests in the losing entity

(1) An *indirect value shift does not have consequences under this
Division if the conditions in this section are met.

(2) The *greater benefits must consist entirely of:

(a) the *losing entity transferring a *CGT asset to the *gaining
entity; or

(b) a right to have the losing entity transfer an asset to the
gaining entity.

(3) There must be *lesser benefits and, as at the *IVS time, the total
*market value of the lesser benefits must not be less than the
greatest of these amounts:

(a) the asset’s *cost base at that time;

(b) the asset’s cost;

#### Indirect value shifts involving services

##### 727-230 Services provided by losing entity to gaining entity for at least their direct cost

An *indirect value shift does not have consequences under this
Division if:

(a) to the extent of at least 95% of their total *market value, the
*greater benefits consist entirely of:

(i) a right to have services that are covered by
section 727-240 provided directly by the losing entity to

##### Section 727-240

(2) If it is reasonable to estimate that an entity providing the same
quantity of services of the same kind in the same market would
charge for them on the basis of a particular percentage mark-up, or
on the basis of a percentage mark-up within a particular range, the
mark-up for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iv) is:

-  the total of the respective present values of the costs
mentioned in subparagraphs (1)(b)(i), (ii) and (iii);

multiplied by:

-  that percentage mark-up, or the highest percentage in that
range.

(3) Otherwise, the mark-up for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(iv)
is 10% of the total of the respective present values of the costs
mentioned in subparagraphs (1)(b)(i), (ii) and (iii).

**Part 3-95 Value shifting**
**Division 727 Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and**
arising from non-arm’s length dealings

##### Section 727-245

##### 727-245 How to work out certain amounts for the purposes of sections 727-230 and 727-235

(1) The costs mentioned in paragraph 727-230(b) or 727-235(1)(b) are
to be worked out:

(a) in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices;
and

(b) to the extent that the services are to be provided in the future,
on the basis of a reasonable estimate of those costs.

(2) To avoid doubt, the direct cost or indirect cost mentioned in
paragraph 727-230(b) or 727-235(1)(b) does not include:

(a) to the extent that the services consist of or include lending
money or providing any other form of financial
accommodation—the amount of the loan or other
accommodation; or

(b) to the extent that the services consist of or include leasing,
renting, hiring, or allowing the use of, any asset:

(i) the cost of acquiring the asset; or

(ii) the cost of acquiring an interest in, or right in respect of,
the asset in order to provide the services.

Example: Acme Ltd is the holding company of Group Financier Pty Ltd. Group
Financier Pty Ltd borrows $20 million at 7% per annum, and on lends
it to other subsidiaries of Acme Ltd at 8% per annum.

The $20 million does not form part of Group Financier Pty Ltd’s
direct cost of the services it provides to the other subsidiaries in the
form of the on lending. However, the 7% interest that Group Financier
Pty Ltd pays on the $20 million does form part of that direct cost.

(3) The present values mentioned in paragraph 727-230(b) or
727-235(1)(b) are to be worked out using a discount rate equal to
the rate that, for the purposes of section 109N of Income Tax
_Assessment Act 1936, is the benchmark interest rate for the income_
year in which the *IVS time occurs.

Note: That section is about distributions to entities connected with a private
company.

non-arm’s length dealings Division 727

##### Section 727-250

#### Anti-overlap provisions

##### 727-250 Distribution by an entity to a member or beneficiary

(1) An *indirect value shift does not have consequences under this
Division if:

(a) the *greater benefits consist entirely of:

(i) a distribution of income or capital that the *losing entity
makes to the *gaining entity; or

(ii) a right to a distribution of income or capital that the
losing entity is to make to the gaining entity;

because the gaining entity holds *primary equity interests in
the losing entity; and

(b) either:

(i) an amount covered by one or more of subsections (2),
(3) and (4); or

(ii) the total of 2 or more such amounts;

equals or exceeds the amount of the distribution.

_Conditions_

(2) This subsection covers an amount that the assessable income or
exempt income of the gaining entity for any income year includes
because of the distribution or right.

(3) This subsection covers an amount by which the *cost base or
*reduced cost base (or both) of some or all of the *primary equity
interests referred to in subsection (1) changes because of the
distribution or right.

(4) This subsection covers an amount that, because of the distribution
or right, is taken into account:

(a) under section 116-20 in working out the *capital proceeds of

(b) in working out a *capital gain that an entity makes from CGT
event E4 or G1 happening during any income year to some or
all of those primary equity interests; or

a distribution of income or capital, this section applies as if the
distribution were a distribution of income or capital the entity
made.

Note: Subsection (5) extends this section to cover something that is taken to
be a dividend paid by a company. Compare item 1 of the table in
subsection 960-120(1).

#### Miscellaneous

##### 727-260 Shift down a wholly-owned chain of entities

(1) An *indirect value shift does not have consequences under this
Division if the *gaining entity is a *wholly-owned subsidiary of the
*losing entity throughout the *IVS period.

_Exception: impact on market value of primary loan interest_

(2) However, subsection (1) does not apply if the *indirect value shift
has produced a *disaggregated attributable decrease, in the *market
value of an *affected interest in the *losing entity that is also a
*primary loan interest in an entity covered by subsection (3), for
the owner of the interest.

(3) This subsection covers:

(a) the *losing entity; and

##### Section 727-415

_Interposed entities_

(2) Tracing is to be done through any interposed entities.

_Ownership or rights held jointly_

(3) If some of the ownership or rights of a particular kind in relation to
a company or trust are held by 2 or more entities jointly or in
common, each of the entities is treated as holding a proportion of
the ownership or rights so held. The proportion is to be worked out
on a reasonable basis, so that the total of the proportions equals the
total of the ownership or rights so held.

_Ownership or rights held by associate_

(4) If, at a particular time:

(a) an *ultimate owner is an *associate of another ultimate
owner; and

(b) the associate ultimately holds some of the ownership or
rights of a particular kind in relation to a company or trust;

then, in determining whether the other ultimate owner is one of 2
or more ultimate owners because of whom the conditions in an
item in the table in section 727-400 are satisfied, the ownership or
rights of that kind in relation to the company or trust held by the
associate at that time:

(c) to the extent of a particular percentage, may be treated as
being instead held by the other ultimate owner; and

(d) to the extent so treated, cannot be treated as being instead
held by any other ultimate owner of whom the first ultimate
owner is an associate.

(5) If one or more applications of subsection (4) are necessary to
establish that an *ultimate owner is one of 2 or more ultimate
owners because of whom the conditions in an item in the table in
section 727-400 are satisfied, that subsection must be applied
accordingly.

(a) each *equity or loan interest that an *affected owner owns in
the losing entity immediately before the *IVS time; and

(b) each equity or loan interest that:

(i) an affected owner owns in another affected owner
immediately before the IVS time; and

(ii) is an *indirect equity or loan interest in the losing entity;

(except one covered by an exception in section 727-470).

##### 727-465  Affected interests in the gaining entity

If immediately before the *IVS time the *gaining entity is a

Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and arising from
non-arm’s length dealings Division 727

##### Section 727-615

(c) by which a gain would, apart from this Division, be *realised
for income tax purposes; and

(d) that happens to an *affected interest in the *gaining entity;
and

(e) that is the first realisation event that happens to that interest
at or after the IVS time.

(4) The consequences for the *affected interest depend on its character.
There are consequences for the interest in its character as a *CGT
asset. However, if the interest is also *trading stock or a *revenue
asset, there are additional consequences for it in that character.

(5) In working out the consequences for an *affected interest in the
*losing entity or *gaining entity, in the interest’s character as
*trading stock, a *realisation event is disregarded for the purposes
of identifying under paragraph (2)(c) or (3)(e) the first realisation
event that happens to that interest at or after the *IVS time, if:

(a) the realisation event consists of the ending of an income year;
and

(b) the *value of the interest as trading stock on hand of an entity
at the end of the income year is the interest’s *cost; and

(c) the interest became part of the entity’s trading stock on hand
during that income year, or the value of the interest as trading
stock of the entity on hand at the start of the income year was
also the interest’s cost.

##### 727-615 Reduction of loss on realisation event for affected interest in losing entity

If this Subdivision applies to a *realisation event that happens to an
*affected interest in the *losing entity, a loss that would, apart from
this Division, be *realised for income tax purposes by the event is
reduced by an amount that is reasonable having regard to:

(a) a reasonable estimate of the amount (if any) by which the
*indirect value shift has reduced the interest’s *market value;

the interest’s market value at the time of the realisation event
still reflects the effect of the indirect value shift on the
market value of *equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.

##### 727-620 Reduction of gain on realisation event for affected interest in gaining entity

If this Subdivision applies to a *realisation event that happens to an
*affected interest in the *gaining entity, a gain that would, apart
from this Division, be *realised for income tax purposes by the
event is reduced by an amount that is reasonable having regard to:

(a) a reasonable estimate of the amount (if any) by which the
*indirect value shift has increased the interest’s *market
value; and

(b) a reasonable estimate of the extent (if any) to which the
interest’s market value at the time of the realisation event still
reflects the effect of the indirect value shift on the market
value of *equity or loan interests in the gaining entity.

##### 727-625 Total gain reductions not to exceed total loss reductions

(1) This section ensures that the total (total gain reductions) of the
amounts by which section 727-620 reduces gains *realised for
income tax purposes by *realisation events happening at the same
time does not exceed the total (total loss reductions) of:

(a) the amounts by which section 727-615 reduces losses that:

(i) would, apart from this Division, be *realised for income
tax purposes by *realisation events happening before or
at that time; and

(ii) have not already been taken into account in a previous
application of this section; and

(b) the amounts by which section 727-850 (as applying to the
*scheme from which the *indirect value shift results) reduces

(ii) have not already been taken into account in a previous
application of this section.

(2) If, apart from this section, the total gain reductions would exceed
the total loss reductions, the amount by which section 727-620
reduces each of the gains is itself reduced by the amount worked
out using this formula:

(Total gain reductions – Total loss reductions)

(1) This section affects how to work out the total gain reductions and
the total loss reductions for the purposes of section 727-625 if:

(a) a *realisation event covered by that section happens to an
*equity or loan interest, or to an *indirect equity or loan
interest, in the *losing entity or in the *gaining entity; and

If an *equity or loan interest in the *losing entity or in the *gaining
entity is split into 2 or more equity or loan interests at or after the

(a) each of the 2 or more interests inherits whatever
characteristics would have been relevant to applying this

(b) those characteristics include characteristics the first interest
has inherited because of any other application or applications
of this section or section 727-640; and

entity; and

(b) section 727-615 reduces a loss that would, apart from this
Division, be *realised for income tax purposes by the CGT

Example: If the Commissioner has notified an entity affected by a determination
under Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the entity
ought reasonably to be aware of the effect of the determination.

##### 727-710 Ongoing or recent service arrangement reduces value of losing entity by at least $100,000

(1) Either or both of these must be true:

(a) when the *realisation event mentioned in

mentioned in paragraph 727-700(2)(a) or (b) have not yet
been provided; or

(b) some or all of those services have been provided in the
income year (of the *losing entity) in which the realisation
event happens, or in the previous income year.

(2) It must be reasonable to conclude that the total (the total market
**_value) of the *market values, immediately before the *realisation_**
event, of *primary interests in the *losing entity then owned by
*affected owners is less than it would have been if none of the
following had happened:

either of these conditions:

(i) its amount was less than $500,000 and it happened

(a) $500,000, if the total of the *adjustable values, immediately
before the *realisation event, of the *primary interests
referred to in subsection (2) is less than or equal to
$10,000,000; or

(b) 5% of the total of those *adjustable values, if that total is
greater than $10,000,000 and less than or equal to
$100,000,000; or

(c) $5,000,000, if that total is greater than $100,000,000.

(4) The providing of the services mentioned in
paragraph 727-700(2)(a) or (b) by the losing entity must not be in
the ordinary course of its business.

##### Section 727-725

##### 727-725 Meaning of predominantly-services indirect value shift

An *indirect value shift is a predominantly-services indirect value
**_shift if, and only if, the *greater benefits consist entirely or_**
predominantly of:

(a) a right to have services that are covered by section 727-240
provided directly by the *losing entity to the *gaining entity;
or

(b) services that are covered by section 727-240 and have been,
are being, or are to be, so provided;

or both.

#### Subdivision 727-H—The adjustable value method

#### Guide to Subdivision 727-H

##### 727-750 What this Subdivision is about

Under the adjustable value method:

-  the adjustable values of affected interests in the losing entity
are reduced; and

-  the adjustable values of affected interests in the gaining entity
are uplifted, within limits worked out by references to the
reductions in the adjustable values of affected interests in the
losing entity.

The consequences of that are:

-  the cost base and reduced cost base of the interests are
reduced or uplifted (or both); and

-  if the interests are also trading stock or revenue assets, there
are further consequences for them in their character as such.

##### 727-755 Consequences of indirect value shift

(1) This Subdivision sets out the adjustable value method of working
out the consequences (if any) of an *indirect value shift.

(2) If those consequences are to be worked out using that method:

(a) the *adjustable value of each *affected interest in the *losing
entity is reduced as provided in this Subdivision; and

(b) if the *gaining entity is a company or trust (except one listed
in section 727-125 (about superannuation entities))
immediately before the *IVS time, the *adjustable value of
each *affected interest in the *gaining entity is uplifted as
provided in this Subdivision.

(3) The consequences for the *affected interest depend on its character.
There are consequences for the interest in its character as a *CGT
asset. However, if the interest is also *trading stock or a *revenue
asset, there are additional consequences for it in that character.

**Part 3-95 Value shifting**
**Division 727 Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and**
arising from non-arm’s length dealings

##### Section 727-770

#### Reductions of adjustable value

##### 727-770 Reduction under the adjustable value method

(1) This section sets out how to work out the amount (if any) by which
the *adjustable value of an *affected interest in the *losing entity is
reduced.

(2) First, work out under section 727-775 whether the *indirect value
shift has produced for the owner of the interest a *disaggregated
attributable decrease in the *market value of the interest.

(3) If it has not, the interest’s *adjustable value is not reduced because
of the *indirect value shift.

(4) If it has, the amount (if any) by which the interest’s *adjustable
value is reduced is worked out on a *loss-focussed basis under
section 727-780.

(5) However, if a choice is made in accordance with section 727-550
for the reduction not to be worked out on a *loss-focussed basis,
the reduction is equal to the *disaggregated attributable decrease.

_Reduction not to exceed reasonable amount_

(6) If the reduction worked out as provided in subsection (4) or (5) is
not reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to the objects of
this Division, the interest’s *adjustable value is instead reduced by
so much of that reduction as is reasonable in the circumstances,
having regard to those objects.

Note: The main object of this Division is set out in section 727-95.

##### 727-775 Has there been a disaggregated attributable decrease?

(1) This section sets out how to determine whether an *indirect value
shift has produced, for the owner of an *equity or loan interest, a
**_disaggregated attributable decrease in the *market value of the_**
interest and, if so, the amount of it.

Value shifting Part 3-95

Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and arising from
non-arm’s length dealings Division 727

##### Section 727-780

(2) Work out the *market value of the interest at the *IVS time, but
disregarding:

(a) all effects on the market value of the interest during the *IVS
period, except effects that are reasonably attributable to the
*indirect value shift; and

(b) the effects (if any) of the indirect value shift on the market
value of *equity or loan interests, or *indirect equity or loan
interests, in the gaining entity.

(This result is called the notional resulting market value.)

Note: Paragraph (2)(b) is necessary because the market value of the interest
may also have been affected by the increase in the market value of
interests in the gaining entity, because the entity in which the interest
is held had direct or indirect interests in both the losing entity and the
gaining entity.

In such a case, the reduction in adjustable value under this Division
will usually be offset by an uplift under this Division.

(3) If the notional resulting *market value is less than the market value
(the old market value) of the interest:

(a) at the start of the *IVS period; or

(b) if the owner last began to own the interest during that
period—when the owner last began to own the interest;

the difference is the disaggregated attributable decrease.

(4) The *indirect value shift has not produced a disaggregated
attributable decrease for the owner of the interest if the notional
resulting *market value is greater than or equal to the old market
value.

(5) The *market value of the interest at a particular time may be
worked out under subsection (2) or (3) by making a reasonable
estimate of that market value.

##### 727-780 Working out the reduction on a loss-focussed basis

(1) Use the table in subsection (2) of this section to work out on a
**_loss-focussed basis the amount (if any) by which the interest’s_**
*adjustable value is reduced.

**Part 3-95 Value shifting**
**Division 727 Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and**
arising from non-arm’s length dealings

##### Section 727-800

(2) This involves comparing the old *market value, and the notional
resulting market value, with the interest’s *adjustable value (the old
**_adjustable value) immediately before the *IVS time._**

**Reduction under the attributable decrease method**


**Item** **If the old market**
**value:**

1 is greater than or
_equal to the old_
adjustable value

2 is greater than or
_equal to the old_
adjustable value

3 is less than the old
adjustable value


**And the notional**
**resulting market**
**value:**

is less than the old
adjustable value

is greater than or
_equal to the old_
adjustable value

is less than the old
adjustable value


**This is the result:**

the *adjustable value is
reduced to the notional
resulting market value

the *adjustable value is
_not reduced because of_
the *indirect value shift

the *adjustable value is
reduced by the amount of
the *disaggregated
attributable decrease


Note 1: Because of item 1, the indirect value shift cannot cause a loss to arise
on disposal of the interest.

Note 2: Because of item 3 the loss already embedded in the interest is
preserved, but the indirect value shift does not increase it.

#### Uplifts of adjustable value

##### 727-800 Uplift under the attributable increase method

(1) This section sets out how to work out the amount (if any) by which
the *adjustable value of an *affected interest in the *gaining entity
is uplifted.

(2) First, work out under section 727-805 whether the *indirect value
shift has produced for the owner of the interest a *disaggregated
attributable increase in the *market value of the interest.

##### Section 727-800

(3) If it has not, the interest’s *adjustable value is not uplifted because
of the *indirect value shift.

(4) If it has, the *adjustable value is uplifted by the amount worked out
using the scaling-down formula in section 727-810, subject to the
rest of this section.

Note: The uplift will be less than or equal to the disaggregated attributable
increase.

_Cap if interest has both a disaggregated attributable increase and_
_a disaggregated attributable decrease_

(5) If the *indirect value shift has also produced for the owner of the
interest a *disaggregated attributable decrease in the *market value
of the interest, the interest’s *adjustable value:

(a) is not uplifted if it is not also reduced under this Division
because of the indirect value shift; and

(b) if it is also reduced under this Division because of the
indirect value shift—is not uplifted by more than the
reduction.

_Cap based on notional distribution by gaining entity of dividends_
_or capital equal to total reductions in adjustable value of affected_
_interests in losing entity_

(6) However, the interest’s *adjustable value is not uplifted by more
than the greater of these amounts:

(a) the amount (if any) that the *affected owner of the interest
would receive (directly, or indirectly through one or more
interposed entities) in respect of the interest if:

(i) the *gaining entity were to pay as *dividends, at the time
(the payment time) immediately before the *IVS time,
an amount (the total reduction amount) equal to the
total of the amounts by which the *adjustable values of
*equity or loan interests in the *losing entity are reduced
under this Subdivision because of the *indirect value
shift; and

gaining entity and that affected owner; and

(b) the amount (if any) that the *affected owner of the interest
would receive (directly, or indirectly through one or more

(i) the gaining entity were to pay the total reduction
amount at the payment time as a distribution of capital;

(6A) The reduction of *adjustable value that is to be taken into account
under subparagraph (6)(a)(i) for an *equity or loan interest in the
*losing entity is:

(a) if the interest is *trading stock immediately before the *IVS
time—the one worked out on the basis of the interest’s
adjustable value under subsection 727-835(2); or

(b) otherwise—the greater or greatest of these:

(i) the reduction of the interest’s *cost base;

(ii) the reduction of the interest’s *reduced cost base;

(iii) the reduction (if any) worked out on the basis of the
interest’s adjustable value under subsection 727-840(2)
(about revenue assets).

_Uplift not to exceed reasonable amount_

(7) If the uplift worked out as provided in subsections (4), (5) and (6)
is not reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to the objects
of this Division, the interest’s *adjustable value is instead uplifted
by an amount that is reasonable in the circumstances, having
regard to those objects.

Value shifting Part 3-95

Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and arising from
non-arm’s length dealings Division 727

##### Section 727-805

##### 727-805 Has there been a disaggregated attributable increase?

(1) This section sets out how to determine whether an *indirect value
shift has produced, for the owner of an *equity or loan interest, a
**_disaggregated attributable increase in the *market value of the_**
interest and, if so, the amount of it.

(2) Make a reasonable estimate of the *market value of the interest at
the *IVS time, but disregarding:

(a) all effects on the market value of the interest during the *IVS
period, except effects that are reasonably attributable to the
*indirect value shift; and

(b) the effects (if any) of the indirect value shift on the market
value of *equity or loan interests, or *indirect equity or loan
interests, in the losing entity.

(This result is called the notional resulting market value.)

Note: Paragraph (2)(b) is necessary because the market value of the interest
may also have been affected by the decrease in the market value of
interests in the losing entity, because the entity in which the interest is
held had direct or indirect interests in both the losing entity and the
gaining entity.

In such a case, the increase in adjustable value under this Division will
usually be offset by a reduction under this Division.

(3) If the notional resulting market value is greater than a reasonable
estimate of the *market value (the old market value) of the interest:

(a) at the start of the *IVS period; or

(b) if the owner last began to own the interest during that
period—when the owner last began to own the interest;

the difference is the disaggregated attributable increase.

(4) The *indirect value shift has not produced a disaggregated
attributable increase for the owner of the interest if the notional
resulting market value is less than or equal to the old market value.

##### Section 727-810

##### 727-810 Scaling-down formula

(1) The scaling-down formula for the purposes of section 727-800 is:


Total reductions


The -  disaggregated for affected interests


attributable increase Total disaggregated


attributable decreases


Note: The numerator in the fraction can never exceed the denominator. This
means that the fraction can never exceed 1, so the uplift will never
exceed the disaggregated attributable increase.

(2) For the purposes of the formula:

**_total disaggregated attributable decreases means the total of:_**

(a) all *disaggregated attributable decreases that the *indirect
value shift has produced, in the *market values of *affected
interests in the *losing entity, for the entities that owned those
interests immediately before the *IVS time; and

(b) if:

(i) section 727-850 (as applying to the *scheme from which
the indirect value shift results) reduces losses that are
*realised for income tax purposes by *realisation events
happening before the *IVS time to *equity or loan
interests, or to *indirect equity or loan interests, in the
losing entity; and

(ii) the indirect value shift is the only indirect value shift, or
is the greater or greatest of 2 or more indirect value
shifts, that results from the scheme and for which the
losing entity is the losing entity;

for each of those realisation events, the amounts that would,
if:

(iii) the *presumed indirect value shift were an indirect value
shift; and

(iv) the IVS time for the presumed indirect value shift were
the time of that realisation event;

Value shifting Part 3-95

Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and arising from
non-arm’s length dealings Division 727

##### Section 727-835

(a) immediately before the adjustment time, the entity had sold
the interest to someone else (at *arm’s length and in the
ordinary course of business) for its *adjustable value
immediately before that time; and

(b) immediately after the adjustment time, the entity had bought
the interest back for the reduced or uplifted adjustable value.

Note: The notional sale and repurchase are separated in time. As a result, if
this section is applied to another indirect value shift that happens later
in the same income year, the interest’s adjustable value will be the
cost on the notional repurchase: see paragraph (2)(b).

(4) However, the increase in the cost of an interest because of
paragraph (3)(b) is taken into account from time to time only to the
extent that the amount of the increase is still reflected in the
*market value of the interest.

Note: The situations where the increase in cost would be taken into account
include:

-  in working out your deductions for the cost of trading stock
acquired during the income year in which the increase happens;
and

-  the end of an income year if the interest’s closing value as
trading stock is worked out on the basis of its cost; and

-  the start of the income year in which the interest is disposed of, if
that happens in a later income year and the interest’s closing
value as trading stock at the end of the previous income year was
worked out on the basis of its cost.

(5) If this Division provides for the *adjustable value of the interest to
be both reduced and uplifted:

(a) the reduction and uplift offset each other to the extent of
whichever of them is the lesser, and subsection (3) of this
section applies accordingly; but

(b) to the extent that the amount of the uplift is no longer
reflected in the *market value of the interest, this section is
taken always to have applied on the basis that the amount of
the uplift was reduced to the same extent.

(1) This section deals with:

(a) how this Division applies to an *equity or loan interest that is
a *revenue asset of an entity at the time (the adjustment time)
immediately before the *IVS time; and

(b) the income tax consequences of this Division reducing or
uplifting the *adjustable value of the interest.

(2) The interest’s adjustable value at a particular time is the total of
the amounts that would be subtracted from the gross disposal
proceeds in calculating any profit or loss on disposal of the interest
if the entity disposed of it at that time.

(3) If this Division reduces or uplifts the interest’s *adjustable value,
the entity is treated as if:

(a) immediately before the adjustment time, the entity had sold
the interest to someone else (at *arm’s length and in the
ordinary course of business) for its adjustable value
immediately before that time; and

(b) immediately after the adjustment time, the entity had bought
the interest back for the reduced or uplifted adjustable value.

Note: The notional sale and repurchase are separated in time. As a result, if
this section is applied to another indirect value shift that happens later
in the same income year, the interest’s adjustable value will be based
on the cost on the notional repurchase: see subsection (2).

(4) However, an uplift in the *adjustable value of the interest is taken
into account only to the extent that the amount of the uplift is still
reflected in the *market value of the interest when it is disposed of
or otherwise realised.

(5) If this Division provides for the *adjustable value of the interest to
be both reduced and uplifted:

(a) the reduction and uplift offset each other to the extent of
whichever of them is the lesser, and subsection (3) of this
section applies accordingly; but

**Part 3-95 Value shifting**
**Division 727 Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and**
arising from non-arm’s length dealings

##### Section 727-850

(f) section 727-860 (about prospective gaining entities) is
satisfied; and

(g) no exclusion in Subdivision 727-C applies to the presumed
indirect value shift because of section 727-865; and

(h) on the assumptions set out in subsection 727-865(3), the
interest would be an *affected interest in the prospective
losing entity;

the loss is reduced by an amount that is reasonable having regard to
a reasonable estimate of the amount (if any) by which the scheme
has reduced the interest’s *market value during the period that ends
at the time of the realisation event and started at the later of:

(i) when the scheme was entered into; and
(j) the time of the last realisation event that happened to the
interest.

Note 1: This Subdivision does not reduce gains from realisation events, but
loss reductions under this Subdivision are taken into account in
working out:

-  gain reductions under Subdivision 727-G for interests in a
gaining entity that are realised after the IVS time for the scheme
(see section 727-625); or

-  uplifts under Subdivision 727-H in the adjustable values of
interests in a gaining entity (see section 727-810).

Note 2: Section 727-865 provides for how other provisions of this Division
apply for the purposes of this Subdivision.

_Further exclusion for certain 95% services indirect value shifts_

(2) The loss is not reduced if the *presumed indirect value shift is a
*95% services indirect value shift because of
subsection 727-865(2), unless:

(a) the conditions in section 727-705 (as applying because of
that subsection) are met for the presumed indirect value shift;
or

(b) the conditions in section 727-710, 727-715 or 727-720 (as
applying because of that subsection) are met for the
presumed indirect value shift and for the realisation event.

Value shifting Part 3-95

Indirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and arising from
non-arm’s length dealings Division 727

##### Section 727-855

##### 727-855 Presumed indirect value shift

(1) The *scheme results in a presumed indirect value shift affecting
the *realisation event if, and only if, as at the time of the realisation
event, it is reasonable to conclude that the total *market value of
the economic benefits (the greater benefits) that:

(a) the *prospective losing entity has *provided, is providing, is
to provide, or might provide, *in connection with the
*scheme, to another entity, or to each of 2 or more other
entities; and

(b) can be identified (even if the other entity or entities cannot be
identified or are not all in existence, or the provision of some
or all of the economic benefits is contingent);

exceeds:

(c) the total market value of the economic benefits (the lesser
**_benefits) that:_**

(i) have been, are being, are to be, or might be, provided to
the prospective losing entity in connection with the
scheme; and

(ii) can be identified (even if the entity or entities providing
the benefits cannot be identified or are not all in
existence, or the provision of some or all of the
economic benefits is contingent); or

(d) if there are no economic benefits covered by paragraph (c)—
nil.

That excess is the amount of the presumed indirect value shift,
which happens at the time of the realisation event.

(2) The *market value of an economic benefit is to be determined as at
the earliest time when it is reasonable to conclude that:

(a) the economic benefit can be identified; and

(b) paragraph 727-150(2)(b) is satisfied for that benefit;

if that time is before the *realisation event.

(3) Otherwise, the *market value of the economic benefit is to be
determined as at the time immediately before the *realisation event,

taking account of any contingency to which provision of the
benefit is subject at that time.

For more rules affecting how the market value of an economic benefit is
determined, see Subdivision 727-D (as applying because of
subsection 727-865(1)).

(4) An entity referred to in paragraph (1)(a) need not be a party to the
*scheme. A benefit can be provided by act or omission.

##### 727-860 Conditions about the prospective gaining entity

(1) By the deadline set out in subsection (5), the conditions in
subsections (2) and (3) must be satisfied for at least one of these
entities:

(a) the entity or entities referred to in paragraph 727-855(1)(a);

(b) if at the time of the *realisation event it is reasonable to
conclude that the entity, or at least one of the entities,
referred to in paragraph 727-855(1)(a) will be one of 2 or
more entities, but it cannot be determined which—those 2 or
more entities.

(2) Enough must be known about the identity of an entity covered by
subsection (1) for it to be reasonable to conclude that, if:

(a) the *presumed indirect value shift were an *indirect value
shift resulting from the *scheme; and

(b) the *IVS period for the scheme ended at the time of the
*realisation event; and

(c) that entity were the *gaining entity for the indirect value
shift;

(d) the *prospective losing entity were the *losing entity for the
indirect value shift; and

either or both of these would be satisfied for the indirect value
shift:

(e) section 727-105 (Ultimate controller test); and

(f) section 727-110 (Common-ownership nexus test).

##### Section 727-865

(3) Enough must be known about the identity of the entity referred to
in subsection (2) for it also to be reasonable to conclude that, in
relation to either or both of the following:

(a) the *prospective losing entity *providing one or more
economic benefits to that entity *in connection with the
*scheme; or

(b) that entity providing one or more economic benefits to the
prospective losing entity in connection with the scheme;

that entity and the prospective losing entity were not, are not, will
not be, or would not be, dealing with each other at *arm’s length.

(4) Each entity that is covered by subsection (1), and for which
subsections (2) and (3) are satisfied, is called a prospective gaining
**_entity for the *scheme._**

(5) The deadline is:

(a) if the entity that owned the *equity or loan interest
immediately before the *realisation event must lodge an
*income tax return for the income year in which the event
happens—the time by which the return must be lodged; or

(b) otherwise—the end of the 6 months immediately after that
income year.

##### 727-865 How other provisions of this Division apply to support this Subdivision

(1) To avoid doubt, these provisions apply for the purposes of working
out whether there has been a *presumed indirect value shift and, if
so, the amount of it:

(a) sections 727-155, 727-160 and 727-165 (about economic
benefits);

(b) section 727-315 (Transfer, for its adjustable value, of
depreciating asset acquired for less than $1,500,000).

(2) For the purposes of section 727-850, these provisions:

(a) Subdivision 727-C (Exclusions), except section 727-260
(about a shift down a wholly-owned chain of entities);

out in subsection (3).

(3) The assumptions are:

(a) the *presumed indirect value shift is an *indirect value shift
resulting from the *scheme; and

entity for that indirect value shift; and

(c) each *prospective gaining entity for the scheme is the
*gaining entity for that indirect value shift; and

are the greater benefits under that indirect value shift; and

(e) the *lesser benefits (if any) under the presumed indirect value
shift are the lesser benefits under that indirect value shift; and

(f) the time of the realisation event mentioned in
paragraph 727-850(1)(c) is the *IVS time for the scheme; and

(g) the *IVS period for the scheme ends at the time of the

(j) a reference to the realisation event mentioned in
subsection 727-700(1) were a reference to the realisation
event mentioned in paragraph 727-850(1)(c); and

(k) the interest to which the realisation event mentioned in

##### Section 727-870

(l) a reference in any of sections 727-700 to 727-725 (about
95% services indirect value shifts), except
subsection 727-700(1), to the owner were a reference to the
entity that, at the time of the realisation event mentioned in
paragraph 727-850(1)(c), owns the interest to which the
event happens.

(4) Sections 727-635 and 727-640 affect how this Subdivision applies
to *equity or loan interests, and *indirect equity or loan interests, in
the *prospective losing entity that are split or merged during the
period:

(a) starting when the *scheme is entered into; and

(b) ending at the time of the *realisation event mentioned in
paragraph 727-850(1)(c);

in the same way as those sections affect how Subdivision 727-G
would apply to those interests on the assumptions set out in
subsection (3) of this section.

(5) The application of a provision because of this section is additional
to, and is not intended to limit, any other application of the
provision.

##### 727-870 Effect of CGT roll-over

(1) If:

(a) the *realisation event mentioned in paragraph 727-850(1)(c)
is a *CGT event; and

(b) section 727-850 reduces a loss that would, apart from this
Division, be *realised for income tax purposes by the CGT
event; and

(c) there is a roll-over for the CGT event;

the interest’s *reduced cost base at the time of the CGT event is
taken to have been reduced by the amount by which
section 727-850 reduces that loss, but is so taken only for the
purposes of working out:

(d) the interest’s reduced cost base, from time to time after the
roll-over, for the entity that *acquired the interest because of
the CGT event; and

(e) in the case of a *replacement-asset roll-over—the reduced
cost base of the replacement CGT asset, from time to time
after the roll-over, for the entity that *disposed of the interest.

Note: Because of the roll-over, the loss reduction under section 727-850 will
have no tax effect. This subsection ensures that the loss reduction is
passed on, through the reduction in reduced cost base, to prevent or
reduce a loss arising on a later CGT event.

##### 727-875 Application to CGT asset that is also trading stock or revenue asset

If an *equity or loan interest is also an item of *trading stock or a
*revenue asset, this Subdivision applies to the interest once in its
character as a CGT asset and again in its character as trading stock
or a revenue asset.

(b) also has consequences under that Division for another entity
as an affected owner of *up interests (or would do so apart
from section 725-90);

the rest of this Subdivision has effect, for the purposes of
Subdivisions 727-A to 727-K, in order to determine:

(c) whether the IVS scheme results in an *indirect value shift,
from the first entity to the other entity, that has consequences
under this Division; and

(d) whether the IVS scheme has consequences under
Subdivision 727-K because it results in a *presumed indirect
value shift affecting a *realisation event happening to *equity
or loan interests, or to *indirect equity or loan interests, in the
first entity; and

(e) those consequences.

Note: Section 725-50 sets out when a direct value shift has consequences
under Division 725.

(3) If:

(a) the IVS scheme is the DVS scheme; and

(b) subsection 725-145(2) is satisfied for the *direct value shift
(because one or more equity or loan interests in the target
entity are issued at a discount); but

(c) subsection 725-145(3) (about an increase in the market value
of one or more equity or loan interests in the target entity) is
not satisfied for the direct value shift;

Subdivisions 727-A to 727-K apply to the IVS scheme only as
provided in this section.

(4) Otherwise, those Subdivisions apply to the IVS scheme as
provided in this section in addition to any other application they
have to the scheme.

##### 727-910 Treatment of value shifted under the direct value shift

*down interests, to the extent that the decrease is (or will be)
covered by subsection 725-155(1).

(2) Despite subsections 727-150(4) and 727-855(2) and (3), the
*market value of all economic benefits that subsection (1) of this
section treats the first entity as providing to the other entity:

(a) is to be determined as at the time immediately before the
*IVS time, or immediately before the *realisation event, as
appropriate; and

(b) is equal to the total value shifted from the *down interests to
the *up interests, as worked out under one or more
applications of step 2 of the method statement in
section 725-365 or 725-380.

(3) The 2 entities are treated as not dealing with each other at *arm’s
length in relation to the providing of those benefits.

(4) None of those benefits is treated as consisting of, or including,
services provided or a right to have services provided.

Note: This means that the exclusions in Subdivisions 727-C and 727-G for
indirect value shifts involving services will not apply.

(5) Except as provided in this section, none of the following is treated
as the *providing of economic benefits *in connection with the IVS
scheme:

(a) a decrease (or future decrease) in the *market value of *down
interests owned by the first entity or the other entity, to the
extent that the decrease is (or will be) covered by
subsection 725-155(1);

(b) an increase (or future increase) in the market value of *up
interests owned by the first entity or the other entity, to the
extent that the increase is (or will be) covered by
subsection 725-145(3);

(c) an issue of *up interests at a *discount to the first entity or the
other entity, to the extent that the issue is (or will be) covered
by subsection 725-145(2).

#### Guide to Subdivision 768-R

##### 768-900 What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision modifies the general tax rules for people in
Australia who are temporary residents, whether Australian
residents or foreign residents.

Generally foreign income derived by temporary residents is
non-assessable non-exempt income and capital gains and losses
they make are also disregarded for CGT purposes. There are some
exceptions for employment-related income and capital gains on
shares and rights acquired under employee share schemes.

Temporary residents are also partly relieved of record-keeping
obligations in relation to the controlled foreign company rules.

for you for the year if you paid it in respect of an amount that is
your *non-assessable non-exempt income under either section 23AI
or 23AK of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 for the year.

country.

_Exception for previously complying funds and previously foreign_
_funds_

(4) An amount of *foreign income tax paid by a *superannuation
provider in relation to a *superannuation fund does not count
towards the *tax offset for the year if:

nature; or

(iii) any other tax, being a tax that is subject to an agreement
having the force of law under the International Tax
_Agreements Act 1953._

imposed in accordance with the relevant foreign law or, where the
foreign jurisdiction has a tax treaty with Australia (having the force of
law under the International Tax Agreements Act 1953), has been
correctly imposed in accordance with that tax treaty.

(2) Credit absorption tax means a tax imposed by a law of a foreign
country, or of any part of, or place in, a foreign country to the
extent that the tax would not have been payable if the entity
concerned or another entity had not been entitled to an offset in
respect of the tax under this Division.

(3) Unitary tax means a tax imposed by a law of a foreign country, or
of any part of, or place in, a foreign country, being a law which, for

situated outside that country, but does not include tax imposed by
that law if that law only takes those matters into account:

(a) if such an associated company is a resident of the foreign
country for the purposes of the law of the foreign country; or

(b) for the purposes of granting any form of relief in relation to
tax imposed on dividends received by one company from
another company.

#### Subdivision 770-B—Amount of foreign income tax offset

#### Guide to Subdivision 770-B

##### 770-65 What this Subdivision is about

The amount of your tax offset is based on the amount of foreign
income tax you have paid.

However, there is a limit on the maximum amount of your offset.
The limit is the greater of $1,000 and an amount worked out under
this Subdivision. This amount is based on a comparison between
your tax liability and the tax liability you would have if certain
foreign-taxed and foreign-sourced income and related deductions
were disregarded.

You may choose to use the limit of $1,000 and not work out this
amount.

There is an increase in the limit to ensure foreign income tax paid
on some amounts that are not taxed always forms part of the offset.

##### Section 770-80

(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), work out the amount of
income tax payable by you, or that would be payable by you,
disregarding any *tax offsets.

(4) Assume that:

(a) your assessable income did not include:

(i) so much of any amount included in your assessable
income as represents an amount in respect of which you
paid *foreign income tax that counts towards the *tax
offset for the year; and

(ii) any other amounts of *ordinary income or *statutory
income from a source other than an *Australian source;
and

(b) you were not entitled to any deductions that:

(i) are *debt deductions that are attributable to an *overseas
permanent establishment of yours; or

(ii) are deductions (other than debt deductions) that are
reasonably related to amounts covered by paragraph (a)
for that year.

Note: You must also assume you were not entitled to any deductions for
certain converted foreign losses: see section 770-35 of the Income Tax
_(Transitional Provisions) Act 1997._

Example: If an entity has paid foreign income tax on a capital gain that
comprises part of its net capital gain, only that capital gain on which
foreign income tax has been paid is disregarded.

##### 770-80 Increase in offset limit for tax paid on amounts to which section 23AI or 23AK of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 apply

Your offset limit under subsection 770-75(2) is increased by any

for you for the year because of subsection 770-10(2).

#### Rules about when foreign tax is paid

##### 770-130 When foreign income tax is considered paid—taxes paid by someone else

(1) This Act applies to you as if you had paid an amount of *foreign
income tax in respect of an amount (a taxed amount) that is all or
part of an amount included in your *ordinary income or *statutory
income if you are covered by subsection (2) or (3) for an amount of
foreign income tax paid in respect of the taxed amount.

tax has been paid in respect of the taxed amount by another entity
under an *arrangement with you or under the law relating to the
foreign income tax.

Example: You are a partner in a partnership and the partnership pays foreign
income tax on the partnership income.

**Part 4-5 General**
**Division 770 Foreign income tax offsets**

##### Section 770-135

(b) foreign income tax has been paid in respect of the other
amount of income; and

(c) the taxed amount is less than it would have been if that tax
had not been paid.

Example: Aust Co (an Australian resident) is the sole beneficiary of an
Australian resident trust H and is presently entitled to all the income
of trust H. Trust H owns shares in For Co (a foreign company). For Co
pays a dividend to trust H and the dividend is subject to withholding
tax in For Co’s country of residence.

Trust H allocates to Aust Co, the dividend, as well as other Australian
source income trust H earned in the year (none of which was subject
to foreign income tax). Aust Co is treated as having paid the foreign
income tax paid by For Co under subsection 770-130(3). The foreign
income tax is treated as paid in respect of the amount included in Aust
Co’s assessable income that is attributable to the dividend.

##### 770-135 Foreign income tax paid by CFCs on attributed amounts

(1) This Division applies to an entity (other than a *CFC) as if it had
paid an amount of *foreign income tax worked out under
subsection (7) in respect of an amount included in its assessable
income if:

(a) the amount is included in its assessable income as described
in subsection (2); and

(b) the conditions in subsections (3) and (5) are satisfied.

(2) An amount is included in an entity’s assessable income as
described in this subsection if the entity is a company and the
amount is included under:

(a) section 456 (a section 456 case) of the 1936 Act in relation to
a *CFC and a statutory accounting period; or

(b) section 457 (a section 457 case) of that Act in relation to a
CFC.

Note: Section 456 of the 1936 Act includes, in the assessable income of
certain Australian shareholders, amounts that are attributable to the
profits of an Australian-controlled foreign company.

Section 457 does likewise when a controlled foreign company
changes residence from an unlisted to a listed country or to Australia.

(7) The amount worked out under this subsection is:

(a) for a section 456 case—the sum of all the tax amounts for the
statutory accounting period multiplied by the company’s
*attribution percentage in relation to the *CFC at the time
mentioned in paragraph (5)(a); or

(b) for a section 457 case—the sum of all the tax amounts to the

##### Section 775-210

##### 775-210 Notional loan

(1) The rules in this section have effect only for the purposes of this
Subdivision.

_Notional loan_

(2) If you issue an *eligible security under a *facility agreement
otherwise than as a result of a roll-over, you are taken to have been
given a loan (the notional loan):

(a) of a *foreign currency principal amount equal to the foreign
currency face value of the security; and

(b) for a period equal to the term of the security; and

(c) that is taken to be attached to the security; and

(d) the start time of which is the time when you issued the
security.

Note 1: The period of the notional loan may be extended as the result of a later
roll-over—see subsection (3).

Note 2: The notional loan may become attached to a later security as the result
of a roll-over—see subsection (3).

Note 3: The foreign currency principal amount of the notional loan may
remain the same, or may fall (but not rise), as a result of a later
roll-over—see subsection (3).

Note 4: If, at a later time, the security is rolled-over, and the foreign currency
face value of the new security exceeds the foreign currency face value
of the rolled-over security, you are taken to have been given an
additional notional loan of a foreign currency principal amount equal
to the excess—see subsection (3).

_Effect of roll-over_

(3) The table has effect if an *eligible security is rolled-over under a
*facility agreement:

issued under a *facility agreement; and

(b) the security is not rolled-over at the time of discharge; and

##### 802-20 Distributions between Australian corporate tax entities— non-assessable non-exempt income

(1) An *Australian corporate tax entity (the receiving entity) has an
amount that is not assessable income and is not *exempt income for
an income year if:

(a) it receives from another Australian corporate tax entity a
*frankable distribution that has an *unfranked part; and

##### Section 802-20

**_total declared CFI amounts means the sum of the declared CFI_**
amounts in distributions made by the receiving entity before the
due day for lodging its *income tax return for the income year.

Example: AusCo 1 and AusCo 2 are both Australian corporate tax entities.

AusCo 1 pays an unfranked dividend of $80 to AusCo 2. AusCo 1
declares all of the $80 to be its conduit foreign income (so the $80 is a
received CFI amount).

AusCo 2 has $5 of deductible expenses relating to the $80 dividend.

AusCo 2 pays an unfranked dividend of $30. AusCo 2 declares $15 of
the $30 to be conduit foreign income (so the $15 is a declared CFI
amount).

The amount that is not assessable income and is not exempt income
for AusCo 2 (assuming there are no other received CFI amounts or
declared CFI amounts) is:

$15
$80   $16
$75

The remaining $64 is included in AusCo 2’s assessable income and it
can deduct $4 (the part of the expenses related to the $64).

(3) If the receiving entity’s expenses that are reasonably related to the
total received CFI amounts equal or exceed the total received CFI
amounts for an income year, the total received CFI amounts is not
assessable income and is not *exempt income of the receiving
entity for the income year.

(4) If a declared CFI amount is taken into account in working out an
amount of *non-assessable non-exempt income of an entity for an
income year, that amount cannot be taken into account for the
entity for a later income year.

(5) Work out how much *conduit foreign income in a *frankable
distribution flows through a trust or a partnership in the same way
that you work out the *share of a *franking credit on a *franked
distribution that flows through a trust or a partnership. That amount
is treated as a received CFI amount under this section.

General Part 4-5

Foreign residents’ income with an underlying foreign source Division 802

##### Section 802-45

##### 802-45 Previous declarations of conduit foreign income

The entity’s conduit foreign income is reduced if:

(a) the entity makes a *frankable distribution that has an
*unfranked part; and

(b) the entity declares an amount of the unfranked part to be
conduit foreign income.

The amount of the reduction is the amount so declared.

Note: If the amount declared is less than the amount available for
declaration, the difference is available for a later declaration.

##### 802-50 Receipt of an unfranked distribution from another Australian corporate tax entity

(1) The entity’s conduit foreign income is reduced if:

(a) the entity (the receiving entity) receives from another
*Australian corporate tax entity a *frankable distribution that
has an *unfranked part; and

(b) the *distribution statement for the *distribution declares an
amount (the declared amount) of the unfranked part to be
conduit foreign income; and

(c) some or all of the declared amount is not *non-assessable

##### Section 802-60

(ii) the entity’s *non-assessable non-exempt income under
section 802-20.

##### 802-60 No streaming of distributions

(1) Subsection (2) has effect if:

(a) an *Australian corporate tax entity makes one or more
*frankable distributions in a *franking period; and

(b) at least one of the *distributions has an *unfranked part; and

(c) the entity declares an amount of the unfranked part to be
*conduit foreign income.

(2) If the entity does not, for that *franking period, declare the same
proportion of *conduit foreign income for all *membership interests
and *non-share equity interests then, instead of the amount that it
declared to be conduit foreign income on those *distributions, it is
taken to have declared under section 802-45 the greater amount
that it would have declared had it declared that same proportion on
all those distributions.

Note: Breaching subsection (2) may make the entity subject to a penalty
under section 288-80 in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act
_1953 (about over declaring conduit foreign income)._

Example: There are 10,000 membership interests in AusCo Limited, 7,500 held
by foreign residents and 2,500 held by Australian residents. It has
$1,800 of conduit foreign income.

AusCo makes an unfranked distribution of 50 cents per membership
interest to all of its members. It declares $1,500 of the distribution to
be conduit foreign income for its 7,500 foreign membership interests
(20 cents per membership interest or 40% of each distribution) and
none for its Australian membership interests.

AusCo is taken to have declared the same proportion (40% of each
distribution) of conduit foreign income for its Australian membership
interests (which amounts to $500 of conduit foreign income). It is
therefore taken to have declared $2,000 of conduit foreign income.
This is an over-declaration of $200 and a penalty under section 288-80
in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 will apply.

##### Section 815-5

#### Operative provisions

##### 815-5 Object

The object of this Subdivision is to ensure the following amounts
are appropriately brought to tax in Australia, consistent with the
arm’s length principle:

(a) profits which would have accrued to an Australian entity if it
had been dealing at *arm’s length, but, by reason of
non-arm’s length conditions operating between the entity and
its foreign associated entities, have not so accrued;

(b) profits which an Australian permanent establishment (within
the meaning of the relevant *international tax agreement) of a
foreign entity might have been expected to make if it were a
distinct and separate entity engaged in the same or similar
activities under the same or similar conditions, but dealing
wholly independently.

##### 815-10 Transfer pricing benefit may be negated

(1) The Commissioner may make a determination mentioned in
subsection 815-30(1), in writing, for the purpose of negating a
*transfer pricing benefit an entity gets.

_Treaty requirement_

(2) However, this section only applies to an entity if:

(a) the entity gets the *transfer pricing benefit under
subsection 815-15(1) at a time when an *international tax
agreement containing an *associated enterprises article
applies to the entity; or

(b) the entity gets the transfer pricing benefit under
subsection 815-15(2) at a time when an international tax
agreement containing a *business profits article applies to the
entity.

##### 815-15 When an entity gets a transfer pricing benefit

_Transfer pricing benefit—associated enterprises_

(1) An entity gets a transfer pricing benefit if:

(a) the entity is an Australian resident; and

(b) the requirements in the *associated enterprises article for the
application of that article to the entity are met; and

(c) an amount of profits which, but for the conditions mentioned
in the article, might have been expected to accrue to the
entity, has, by reason of those conditions, not so accrued; and

(d) had that amount of profits so accrued to the entity:

(i) the amount of the taxable income of the entity for an
income year would be greater than its actual amount; or

(ii) the amount of a tax loss of the entity for an income year
would be less than its actual amount; or

(iii) the amount of a *net capital loss of the entity for an
income year would be less than its actual amount.

The amount of the transfer pricing benefit is the difference
between the amounts mentioned in subparagraph (d)(i), (ii) or (iii)
(as the case requires).

_Transfer pricing benefit—business profits_

(2) A foreign resident entity gets a transfer pricing benefit if:

(a) the entity has a permanent establishment (within the meaning
of the *international tax agreement) in Australia; and

(b) the amount of profits attributed to the permanent
establishment falls short of the amount of profits the
permanent establishment might be expected to make if it
were a distinct and separate entity engaged, and dealing, in
the manner mentioned in the *business profits article; and

income year would be greater than its actual amount; or

(ii) the amount of a tax loss of the entity for an income year
would be less than its actual amount; or

between the amounts mentioned in subparagraph (c)(i), (ii) or (iii)
(as the case requires).

_Nil amounts_

(3) For the purposes of working out whether an entity gets a *transfer
pricing benefit, and of negating that benefit under
subsection 815-30(1):

(a) treat an entity that has no taxable income for an income year
as having a taxable income for the year of a nil amount; and

(b) treat an entity that has no tax loss for an income year as
having a tax loss for the year of a nil amount; and

(c) treat an entity that has no *net capital loss for an income year
as having a net capital loss for the year of a nil amount.

_Multiple transfer pricing benefits_

(4) To avoid doubt, an entity may get 2 or more *transfer pricing
benefits, in one or more income years, in relation to one amount of
profits, or one shortfall of profits.

_Meaning of associated enterprises article_

(5) An associated enterprises article is:

(a) Article 9 of the United Kingdom convention (within the
meaning of the International Tax Agreements Act 1953); or

(b) a corresponding provision of another *international tax
agreement.

apart from this section would get, in an income year if:

(a) Division 820 (about thin capitalisation) applies to the entity
for the income year; and

(b) the transfer pricing benefit relates to profits, or a shortfall of
profits, referable to costs that are *debt deductions of the
entity for the income year.

(2) If working out what those costs might have been, or might be
expected to be, involves applying a rate to a *debt interest:

(a) work out the rate by applying section 815-15, having regard
to section 815-20; but

(c) a determination of an amount by which the *net capital loss
of the entity for an income year is decreased.

(2) If the Commissioner makes a determination under subsection (1),
the determination is taken to be attributable, to the relevant extent,
to such of the following as the Commissioner may determine:

(a) an increase of a particular amount in assessable income of the
entity for an income year under a particular provision of this
Act;

(b) a decrease of a particular amount in particular deductions of
the entity for an income year;

(c) an increase of a particular amount in particular capital gains

#### Operative provisions

##### 815-105 Object

(1) The object of this Subdivision is to ensure that the amount brought
to tax in Australia from cross-border conditions between entities is
not less than it would be if those conditions reflected:

(a) the arm’s length contribution made by Australian operations
through functions performed, assets used and risks assumed;
and

(b) the conditions that might be expected to operate between
entities dealing at *arm’s length.

(2) The Subdivision does this by specifying that, where an entity
would otherwise get a tax advantage from actual conditions that
differ from *arm’s length conditions, the arm’s length conditions
are taken to operate for income tax and withholding tax purposes.

capitalisation) in its application to reduce, or further reduce, *debt
deductions of an entity.

##### 815-115 Substitution of arm’s length conditions

(1) For the purposes covered by subsection (2), if an entity gets a
*transfer pricing benefit from conditions that operate between the
entity and another entity in connection with their commercial or
financial relations:

(a) those conditions are taken not to operate; and

(b) instead, the *arm’s length conditions are taken to operate.

Note 1: The conditions that operate include, but are not limited to, such things
as price, gross margin, net profit, and the division of profit between
the entities.

Note 2: There are special rules about documentation that affect when an entity
has a reasonably arguable position about the application (or
non-application) of this Subdivision: see Subdivision 284-E in
Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.

(2) The purposes covered by this subsection are:

(a) if the *transfer pricing benefit arises under
subparagraph 815-120(1)(c)(i)—working out the amount (if
any) of the entity’s taxable income for the income year; and

(b) if the transfer pricing benefit arises under
subparagraph 815-120(1)(c)(ii)—working out the amount (if
any) of the entity’s loss of a particular *sort for the income
year; and

operate between the entity and another entity in connection with
their commercial or financial relations if:

(a) those conditions (the actual conditions) differ from the
*arm’s length conditions; and

(b) the actual conditions satisfy the cross-border test in
subsection (3) for the entity; and

(c) had the arm’s length conditions operated, instead of the
actual conditions, one or more of the following would, apart
from this Subdivision, apply:

(i) the amount of the entity’s taxable income for an income
year would be greater;

(ii) the amount of the entity’s loss of a particular *sort for an
income year would be less;

(iii) the amount of the entity’s *tax offsets for an income
year would be less;

##### 815-215 Substitution of arm’s length profits

(1) For the purposes covered by subsection (2), if an entity gets a
*transfer pricing benefit from the attribution of profits to a *PE of
the entity:

(a) the amount of profits actually attributed to the PE is taken not
to have been so attributed; and

(b) instead, the *arm’s length profits are taken to have been
attributed to the PE.

Note: There are special rules about documentation that affect when an entity
has a reasonably arguable position about the application (or
non-application) of this Subdivision: see Subdivision 284-E in
Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953.

(2) The purposes covered by this subsection are:

(a) if the *transfer pricing benefit arises under
subparagraph 815-220(1)(b)(i)—working out the amount (if
any) of the entity’s taxable income for the income year; and

(b) if the transfer pricing benefit arises under
subparagraph 815-220(1)(b)(ii)—working out the amount (if
any) of a loss of a particular *sort for the income year; and

(b) had the arm’s length profits, instead of the actual profits,
been attributed to the PE, one or more of the following
would, apart from this Subdivision, apply:

(i) the amount of the entity’s taxable income for an income

##### 815-225 Meaning of arm’s length profits

(1) The arm’s length profits for a *PE of an entity are worked out by
allocating the actual expenditure and income of the entity between
the PE and the entity so that the profits attributed to the PE equal
the profits the PE might be expected to make if:

(a) the PE were a distinct and separate entity; and

(b) the activities and circumstances of the PE, including the
functions performed, assets used and risks borne by the PE,
were those of that separate entity; and

(c) the conditions that operated between that separate entity and
the entity of which it is a PE were the *arm’s length
conditions.

(2) The conditions to which the *arm’s length conditions mentioned in
paragraph (1)(c) relate are the conditions that would operate
between the separate entity and the entity of which it is a *PE if the
assumptions in paragraphs (1)(a) and (b) were made.

(1) An entity is a **_country by country reporting parent (or CBC_**
**_reporting parent) for a period if:_**

##### Section 815-380

(a) all the members of a group that is consolidated for
accounting purposes as a single group (the smaller group)
are members of:

(i) another such group; or

(ii) a *notional listed company group; and

(b) at least one entity is a member of the group mentioned in
subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii) but is not a member of the smaller
group.

(4) Subsection (5) also applies if:

(a) all the *members of a notional listed company group (the
**_smaller group) are members of:_**

(i) another such group; or

(ii) a group that is consolidated for accounting purposes as a
single group; and

(b) at least one entity is a member of the group mentioned in
subparagraph (a)(i) or (ii) but is not a member of the smaller

(5) For the purposes of subsection (1), treat the smaller group as not
being any of the following:

(a) a group that is consolidated for accounting purposes as a
single group;

(b) a *notional listed company group.

(6) For the purposes of this section, assume that
paragraph 960-575(4)(a) were disregarded:

(a) in determining whether a *notional listed company group
exists; and

(b) in identifying the *members of a notional listed company
group.

Note: The effect of that assumption is that certain exceptions in accounting
or other principles to requirements to consolidate for accounting
purposes are taken into account in working out the membership of the
country by country reporting group. Where such exceptions apply, a
country by country reporting group may have fewer members than the
equivalent notional listed company group.

##### 820-1 What this Division is about

This Division applies to foreign controlled Australian entities,
Australian entities that operate internationally and foreign entities
that operate in Australia.

Financing expenses that an entity can otherwise deduct from its
assessable income may be disallowed under this Division in the
following circumstances:

-  for an entity that is not an authorised deposit-taking institution
for the purposes of the Banking Act 1959 (an ADI)—the
entity’s debt exceeds the prescribed level (and the entity is
therefore “thinly capitalised”);

-  for an entity that is an ADI—the entity’s capital is less than
the prescribed level (and the entity is therefore “thinly
capitalised”).

(3) The conditions are:

(a) the entity is one established for the purposes of managing
some or all of the economic risk associated with assets,
liabilities or investments (whether the entity assumes the risk
from another entity or creates the risk itself); and

(b) the total value of *debt interests in the entity is at least 50%

_Thin capitalisation rule_

(1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of
an entity for an income year (to the extent that it is not attributable
to an *overseas permanent establishment of the entity) if, for that
year:

(a) the entity is an *outward investing entity (non-ADI) (see
subsection (2)); and

(b) the entity’s *adjusted average debt (see subsection (3))
exceeds its *maximum allowable debt (see section 820-90).

Note 1: This Subdivision does not apply if the total debt deductions of that
entity and all its associate entities for that year are $2 million or less,
see section 820-35.

Note 2: To work out the amount to be disallowed, see section 820-115.

Note 3: For the rules that apply to an entity that is an outward investing entity
(non-ADI) for only a part of an income year, see section 820-120 in
conjunction with subsection (2) of this section.

Note 4: A consolidated group or MEC group may be an outward investing
entity (non-ADI) to which this Subdivision applies: see
Subdivisions 820-FA and 820-FB.

_Outward investing entity (non-ADI)_

(2) The entity is an outward investing entity (non-ADI) for a period
that is all or a part of an income year if, and only if, it is:

(a) an *outward investor (general) for that period (as set out in
items 1 and 3 of the following table); or

(b) an *outward investor (financial) for that period (as set out in
items 2 and 4 of that table).

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of all
the assets of the entity.

Step 1A. Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

Step 2. Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for
that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

Step 3. Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

Step 4. Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *controlled foreign entity debt of the
entity.

Step 5. Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *controlled foreign entity equity of the
entity.

Step 6. Reduce the result of step 5 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *non-debt liabilities of the entity. If the
result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be
nil.

Step 7. Multiply the result of step 6 by 3/5.

Step 8. Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the safe harbour debt amount.

Example: AK Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average
value of assets (other than assets attributable to its overseas permanent
establishments) of $100 million.

##### Section 820-100

foreign entity equity and non-debt liabilities are $5 million, $10
million, $8 million, $5 million, $2 million and $5 million respectively.
Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying
steps 1A to 6) leaves $65 million. Multiplying $65 million by 3/5
results in $39 million. As the average value of the company’s
associate entity excess amount is $4.5 million, the safe harbour debt
amount is therefore $43.5 million.

##### 820-100 Safe harbour debt amount—outward investor (financial)

(1) If the entity is an *outward investor (financial) for the income year,
the safe harbour debt amount is the lesser of the following
amounts:

(a) the *total debt amount (worked out under subsection (2));

(b) the *adjusted on-lent amount (worked out under
subsection (3)).

However, if the 2 amounts are equal, it is the total debt amount.

_Total debt amount_

(2) The total debt amount is the result of applying the method
statement in this subsection. In applying the method statement,
disregard any amount that is attributable to the entity’s *overseas
permanent establishments.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of all
the assets of the entity.

Step 1A. Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

Step 2. Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for
that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

Step 3. Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

year, of all the *controlled foreign entity debt of the
entity.

Step 5. Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *controlled foreign entity equity of the
entity.

Step 6. Reduce the result of step 5 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *non-debt liabilities of the entity.

Step 7. Reduce the result of step 6 by the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *zero-capital amount. If the result of
this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

Step 8. Multiply the result of step 7 by 15/16.

Step 9. Add to the result of step 8 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *zero-capital amount.

Step 10. Add to the result of step 9 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the total debt amount.

Example: GLM Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average
value of assets (other than assets attributable to its overseas permanent
establishments) of $160 million.

The average values of its relevant excluded equity interests, associate
entity debt, associate entity equity, controlled foreign entity debt,
controlled foreign entity equity, non-debt liabilities and zero-capital
amount are $5 million, $5 million, $5 million, $9 million, $6 million,
$5 million and $4 million respectively. Deducting these amounts from
the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 7) leaves $121
million. Multiplying $121 million by 15/16 results in $113.4375
million. Adding the average zero-capital amount of $4 million results
in $117.4375 million. As the company does not have any associate
entity excess amount, the total debt amount is therefore $117.4375
million.

_Adjusted on-lent amount_

(3) The adjusted on-lent amount is the result of applying the method
statement in this subsection. In applying the method statement,
disregard any amount that is attributable to the entity’s *overseas
permanent establishments.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of all
the assets of the entity.

Step 1A. Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

Step 2. Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for
that year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

Step 3. Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *controlled foreign entity debt of the
entity.

Step 4. Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *controlled foreign entity equity of the
entity.

Step 5. Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that

Step 6. Reduce the result of step 5 by the amount (the average
**_on-lent amount) which is the average value, for that_**
year, of the entity’s *on-lent amount (other than
*controlled foreign entity debt of the entity). If the result
of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

Step 7. Multiply the result of step 6 by 3/5.

Step 9. Reduce the result of step 8 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

Step 10. Add to the result of step 9 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the adjusted on-lent amount.

Example: GLM Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average
value of assets (other than assets attributable to its overseas permanent
establishments) of $160 million.

The average values of its relevant excluded equity interests, associate
entity equity, controlled foreign entity debt, controlled foreign entity
equity, non-debt liabilities and on-lent amount are $5 million, $5
million, $9 million, $6 million, $5 million and $35 million
respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step 1
(through applying steps 1A to 6) leaves $95 million. Multiplying $95
million by 3/5 results in $57 million. Adding the average on-lent
amount of $35 million results in $92 million. Reducing the result of
step 8 by the associate entity debt amount of $5 million equals $87
million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess
amount, the adjusted on-lent amount is therefore $87 million.

##### 820-105 Arm’s length debt amount

(1) The arm’s length debt amount is a notional amount that, having
regard to the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2) and the
relevant factors mentioned in subsection (3), would satisfy both
paragraphs (a) and (b):

(a) the amount represents a notional amount of *debt capital that:

(i) the entity would reasonably be expected to have
throughout the income year; and

(ii) would give rise to an amount of *debt deductions of the
entity for that or any other income year; and

(iii) would be attributable to the entity’s Australian business
as mentioned in subsection (2);

(b) commercial lending institutions that were not *associates of
the entity (the notional lenders) would reasonably be
expected to have entered into *schemes that would:

##### Section 820-110

##### 820-110 Worldwide gearing debt amount—outward investor that is not also an inward investment vehicle

_Outward investor (general) that is not also an inward investment_
_vehicle (general)_

(1) If the entity is an *outward investor (general) for the income year,
and not also an *inward investment vehicle (general) for all or any
part of that year, the worldwide gearing debt amount is the result
of applying the method statement in this subsection.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Divide the average value of all the entity’s *worldwide
debt for the income year by the average value of all the
entity’s *worldwide equity for that year.

Step 3. Add 1 to the result of step 1.

Step 4. Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 3.

Step 5. Multiply the result of step 4 in this method statement by
the result of step 6 in the method statement in
section 820-95.

Step 6. Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the worldwide gearing debt amount.

Example: AK Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average
value of worldwide debt of $90 million and an average value of
worldwide equity of $30 million. The result of applying step 1 is
therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 3 and 4) and
multiplying the result by $65 million (which is the result of step 6 in
the method statement in section 820-95) equals $48.75 million. As the
average value of the company’s associate entity excess amount is $4.5
million, the worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $53.25
million.

(2) If the entity is an *outward investor (financial) for that year, and
not also an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for all or any
part of that year, the worldwide gearing debt amount is the result
of applying the method statement in this subsection.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Divide the average value of all the entity’s *worldwide
debt for the income year by the average value of all the
entity’s *worldwide equity for that year.

Step 3. Add 1 to the result of step 1.

Step 4. Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 3.

Step 5. Multiply the result of step 4 in this method statement by
the result of step 7 in the method statement in
subsection 820-100(2).

Step 6. Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *zero-capital amount (other than any
zero-capital amount that is attributable to the entity’s
*overseas permanent establishments).

Step 7. Add to the result of step 6 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the worldwide gearing debt amount.

Example: GLM Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average
value of worldwide debt of $120 million and an average value of
worldwide equity of $40 million. The result of applying step 1 is
therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying steps 3 and 4) and
multiplying the result by $121 million (which is the result of step 7 of
the method statement in subsection 820-100(2)) equals $90.75 million.
The average value of zero-capital amount (see step 7 of the method
statement in subsection 820-100(2)) is $4 million. Adding that amount

to $90.75 million results in $94.75 million. As the company does not
have any associate entity excess amount, the worldwide gearing debt
amount is therefore $94.75 million.

##### 820-111 Worldwide gearing debt amount—outward investor that is also an inward investment vehicle

_Outward investor (general)_

(1) If the entity is an *outward investor (general) for the income year,
and is also an *inward investment vehicle (general) for all or any
part of that year, the worldwide gearing debt amount is the result
of applying the method statement in this subsection.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Divide the entity’s *statement worldwide debt for the
income year by the entity’s *statement worldwide equity
for that year.

Step 2. Add 1 to the result of step 1.

Step 3. Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

Step 4. Multiply the result of step 3 in this method statement by
the result of step 6 in the method statement in
section 820-95.

Step 5. Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the worldwide gearing debt amount.

Example: RKR Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has a worldwide
parent entity in Canada. RKR Limited also has permanent
establishments in Singapore. RKR Limited has statement worldwide
debt of $120 million and statement worldwide equity of $40 million.
The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through
applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $75 million
(which is the result of step 6 of the method statement in
section 820-95) equals $56.25 million. As the average value of the

and is also an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for all or any
part of that year, the worldwide gearing debt amount is the result
of applying the method statement in this subsection.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Divide the entity’s *statement worldwide debt for the
income year by the entity’s *statement worldwide equity
for that year.

Step 2. Add 1 to the result of step 1.

Step 3. Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

result of this step is the worldwide gearing debt amount.

Example: TRR Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has a worldwide
parent entity in the United States of America. TRR Limited also has
permanent establishments in Malaysia. TRR Limited has statement
worldwide debt of $90 million and statement worldwide equity of $30

subsection 820-100(2)) equals $75 million. The zero capital amount is
$5 million. Adding that amount to $75 million results in $80 million.
As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the
worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $80 million.

##### 820-115 Amount of debt deduction disallowed

The amount of *debt deduction disallowed under
subsection 820-85(1) is worked out using the following formula:

Excess debt
Debt deduction  Average debt

where:

**_average debt means the sum of:_**

(a) the average value, for the income year, of the entity’s *debt
capital that is covered by step 1 of the method statement in
subsection 820-85(3); and

(b) the average value, for that year, of the entity’s *cost-free debt
capital that is covered by step 5 of that method statement;

(disregarding any amount that is attributable to the entity’s
*overseas permanent establishments in working out the average
values).

**_debt deduction means each *debt deduction covered by_**
subsection 820-85(1).

**_excess debt means the amount by which the entity’s *adjusted_**
average debt for that year (see subsection 820-85(3)) exceeds its
*maximum allowable debt for that year.

Note: The disallowed amount also does not form part of the cost base of a
CGT asset. See section 110-54.

##### 820-120 Application to part year periods

(a) the entity is an *outward investing entity (non-ADI) for that
period; and

(b) the entity’s *adjusted average debt for that period exceeds the
entity’s *maximum allowable debt for that period.

Note: To determine whether an entity is an outward investing entity
(non-ADI) for that period, see subsection 820-85(2).

(2) The entity’s adjusted average debt for that period is the result of
applying the method statement in this subsection. In applying the
method statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to the
entity’s *overseas permanent establishments.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for that period, of all the
*debt capital of the entity that gives rise to *debt
deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.

Step 2. Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that
period, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

Step 3. Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that
period, of all the *controlled foreign entity debt of the
entity.

Step 4. If the entity is a *financial entity throughout that period,
add to the result of step 3 the average value, for that
period, of the entity’s *borrowed securities amount.

Step 5. Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that
period, of the *cost-free debt capital of the entity. The
result of this step is the adjusted average debt.

##### 820-195 Safe harbour debt amount—inward investment vehicle (general)

If the entity is an *inward investment vehicle (general) for the
income year, the safe harbour debt amount is the result of
applying the method statement in this section.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of all
the assets of the entity.

Step 1A. Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

Step 2. Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for
that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

Step 3. Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

Step 4. Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *non-debt liabilities of the entity. If the
result of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be
nil.

Step 5. Multiply the result of step 4 by 3/5.

Step 6. Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the safe harbour debt amount.

##### Section 820-200

Example: ALWZ Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an average
value of assets of $100 million.

The average values of its excluded equity interests, associate entity
debt, associate entity equity and non-debt liabilities are $5 million,
$10 million, $5 million and $5 million respectively. Deducting these
amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 4)
leaves $75 million. Multiplying $75 million by 3/5 results in $45
million. As the average value of the company’s associate entity excess
amount is $2 million, the safe harbour debt amount is therefore $47
million.

##### 820-200 Safe harbour debt amount—inward investment vehicle (financial)

(1) If the entity is an *inward investment vehicle (financial) for the
income year, the safe harbour debt amount is the lesser of the
following amounts:

(a) the *total debt amount (worked out under subsection (2));

(b) the *adjusted on-lent amount (worked out under
subsection (3)).

However, if the 2 amounts are equal, it is the total debt amount.

_Total debt amount_

(2) The total debt amount is the result of the method statement in this
subsection.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of all
the assets of the entity.

Step 1A. Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

Step 2. Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for
that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity.

Step 3. Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity.

Step 4. Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *non-debt liabilities of the entity.

Step 5. Reduce the result of step 4 by the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *zero-capital amount. If the result of
this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

Step 6. Multiply the result of step 5 by 15/16.

Step 7. Add to the result of step 6 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *zero-capital amount.

Step 8. Add to the result of step 7 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the total debt amount.

Example: KJW Finance Pty Ltd, a company that is an Australian entity, has an
average value of assets of $120 million.

The average values of its excluded equity interests, associate entity
debt, associate entity equity, its non-debt liabilities and its zero-capital
amount are $5 million, $5 million, $3 million, $2 million and $5
million respectively. Deducting these amounts from the result of step
1 (through applying steps 1A to 5) leaves $100 million. Multiplying
$100 million by 15/16 results in $93.75 million. Adding the
zero-capital amount of $5 million to $93.75 million results in $98.75
million. As the company does not have any associate entity excess
amount, the total debt amount is therefore $98.75 million.

_Adjusted on-lent amount_

(3) The adjusted on-lent amount is the result of applying the method
statement in this subsection.

The average values of its excluded equity interests, associate entity
equity, non-debt liabilities and on-lent amount are $5 million, $3
million, $2 million and $35 million respectively. Deducting these
amounts from the result of step 1 (through applying steps 1A to 4)
leaves $75 million. Multiplying $75 million by 3/5 results in $45

##### 820-205 Safe harbour debt amount—inward investor (general)

If the entity is an *inward investor (general) for the income year,
the safe harbour debt amount is the result of applying the method
statement in this section.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of all of
the following assets of the entity (the Australian
**_investments):_**

(a) assets that are attributable to the entity’s
*Australian permanent establishments;

(b) other assets that are held for the purposes of
producing the entity’s assessable income.

Step 1A. Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *excluded equity interests in the entity.

Step 2. Reduce the result of step 1A by the average value, for
that year, of all the *associate entity debt of the entity that
has arisen because of the Australian investments.

Step 3. Reduce the result of step 2 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *associate entity equity of the entity that
has arisen because of the Australian investments.

Step 4. Reduce the result of step 3 by the average value, for that
year, of all the *non-debt liabilities of the entity that have
arisen because of the Australian investments. If the result
of this step is a negative amount, it is taken to be nil.

Step 5. Multiply the result of step 4 by 3/5.

Step 6. Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that

result of this step is the safe harbour debt amount.

Example: RJ Corporation is a company that is not an Australian entity. The
average value of its Australian investments is $100 million.

The average value of its relevant excluded equity interests, associate
entity debt, associate entity equity and non-debt liabilities is $5
million, $10 million, $5 million and $5 million respectively.
Deducting those amounts from the result of step 1 leaves $75 million.
Multiplying $75 million by 3/5 results in $45 million. As the company
does not have any associate entity excess amount, the safe harbour
debt amount is therefore $45 million.

##### 820-210 Safe harbour debt amount—inward investor (financial)

(1) If the entity is an *inward investor (financial) for that year, the safe
**_harbour debt amount is the lesser of the following amounts:_**

(a) the *total debt amount (worked out under subsection (2));

(b) the *adjusted on-lent amount (worked out under

Example: SJP Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has a worldwide
parent entity in Japan. SJP Limited has statement worldwide debt of
$120 million and statement worldwide equity of $40 million. The
result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through
applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $75 million
(which is the result of step 4 of the method statement in
section 820-195) equals $56.25 million. As the average value of the
company’s associate entity excess amount is $4 million, the
worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $60.25 million.

**Division 820 Thin capitalisation rules**

##### Section 820-218

Example: RGR Limited, a company that is an Australian entity, has a worldwide
parent entity in France. RGR Limited has statement worldwide debt of
$90 million and statement worldwide equity of $30 million. The result
of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through applying
steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $100 million (which is the
result of step 5 of the method statement in subsection 820-200(2))
equals $75 million. The zero capital amount is $5 million. Adding that
amount to $75 million results in $80 million. As the company does not
have any associate entity excess amount, the worldwide gearing debt
amount is therefore $80 million.

##### 820-218 Worldwide gearing debt amount—inward investor (general)

If the entity is an *inward investor (general) for the income year,
the worldwide gearing debt amount is the result of applying the
method statement in this section.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Divide the entity’s *statement worldwide debt for the
income year by the entity’s *statement worldwide equity
for that year.

Step 2. Add 1 to the result of step 1.

Step 3. Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

Step 4. Multiply the result of step 3 in this method statement by
the result of step 4 in the method statement in
section 820-205.

Step 5. Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the worldwide gearing debt amount.

Example: MLO Limited, a company that is not an Australian entity, has
investments in Australia. MLO Limited has statement worldwide debt
of $120 million and statement worldwide equity of $40 million.

##### Section 820-219

The result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through
applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $75 million
(which is the result of step 4 of the method statement in
section 820-205) equals $56.25 million. As the average value of the
company’s associate entity excess amount is $4 million, the
worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $60.25 million.

##### 820-219 Worldwide gearing debt amount—inward investor (financial)

If the entity is an *inward investor (financial) for the income year,
the worldwide gearing debt amount is the result of applying the
method statement in this section.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Divide the entity’s *statement worldwide debt for the
income year by the entity’s *statement worldwide equity
for that year.

Step 2. Add 1 to the result of step 1.

Step 3. Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.

Step 4. Multiply the result of step 3 in this method statement by
the result of step 5 in the method statement in
subsection 820-210(2).

Step 5. Add to the result of step 4 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *zero-capital amount that has arisen
because of the Australian investments mentioned in step
1 of the method statement in subsection 820-210(2).

Step 6. Add to the result of step 5 the average value, for that
year, of the entity’s *associate entity excess amount. The
result of this step is the worldwide gearing debt amount.

Example: MSR Limited, a company that is not an Australian entity, has
investments in Australia. MSR Limited has statement worldwide debt

##### Section 820-220

of $90 million and statement worldwide equity of $30 million. The
result of applying step 1 is therefore 3. Dividing 3 by 4 (through
applying steps 2 and 3) and multiplying the result by $100 million
(which is the result of step 5 of the method statement in
subsection 820-210(2)) equals $75 million. The zero-capital amount is
$5 million. Adding that amount to $75 million results in $80 million.
As the company does not have any associate entity excess amount, the
worldwide gearing debt amount is therefore $80 million.

##### 820-220 Amount of debt deduction disallowed

The amount of *debt deduction disallowed under
subsection 820-185(1) is worked out using the following formula:

Excess debt
Debt deduction  Average debt

where:

**_average debt means the sum of:_**

(a) the average value, for the income year, of the entity’s *debt
capital that is covered by step 1 of the method statement in
subsection 820-185(3); and

(b) the average value, for that year, of the entity’s *cost-free debt
capital that is covered by step 4 of that method statement.

**_debt deduction means each *debt deduction of the entity for that_**
year.

**_excess debt means the amount by which the *adjusted average debt_**
(see subsection 820-185(3)) exceeds the entity’s *maximum
allowable debt for that year.

Note: The disallowed amount also does not form part of the cost base of a
CGT asset. See section 110-54.

##### 820-225 Application to part year periods

(1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of
an entity for an income year that is an amount incurred by the
entity during a period that is a part of that year, if:

##### Section 820-225

(a) the entity is an *inward investing entity (non-ADI) for that
period, but is not also an *outward investing entity (non-ADI)
for all or any part of that period; and

(b) the entity’s *adjusted average debt for that period exceeds the
entity’s *maximum allowable debt for that period.

Note: To determine whether an entity is an inward investing entity
(non-ADI) for a period, see subsection 820-185(2).

(2) The entity’s adjusted average debt for that period is the result of
applying the method statement in this subsection.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for that period, of all the
*debt capital of the entity that gives rise to *debt
deductions of the entity for that or any other income year.

Step 2. Reduce the result of step 1 by the average value, for that
period, of:

(a) if the entity is an *inward investment vehicle
(general) or an *inward investment vehicle
(financial) for that period—all the *associate entity
debt of the entity; or

(b) if the entity is an *inward investor (general) or an
*inward investor (financial) for that period—all the
associate entity debt of the entity, to the extent that
it is attributable to the entity’s *Australian
permanent establishments.

Step 3. If the entity is a *financial entity throughout that period,
add to the result of step 2 the average value, for that
period, of the entity’s *borrowed securities amount.

##### Section 820-300

#### Operative provisions

##### 820-300 Thin capitalisation rule for outward investing entities (ADI)

_Thin capitalisation rule_

(1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of
an entity for an income year (to the extent that it is not attributable
to an *overseas permanent establishment of the entity) if, for that
year:

(a) the entity is an *outward investing entity (ADI) (see
subsection (2)); and

(b) the entity’s *adjusted average equity capital (see
subsection (3)) is less than the entity’s *minimum capital
amount (see section 820-305).

Note 1: This Subdivision does not apply if the total debt deductions of that
entity and all its associate entities for that year are $2 million or less,
see section 820-35.

Note 2: To work out the amount to be disallowed, see section 820-325.

Note 3: For the rules that apply to an entity that is an outward investing entity
(ADI) for only part of an income year, see section 820-330 in
conjunction with subsection (2) of this section.

Note 4: A consolidated group or MEC group may be an outward investing
entity (ADI) to which this Subdivision applies: see
Subdivisions 820-FA and 820-FB.

_Outward investing entity (ADI)_

(2) The entity is an outward investing entity (ADI) for a period that is
all or a part of an income year if, and only if, throughout that
period, the entity is an *ADI to which at least one of the following
paragraphs applies:

(a) the entity is an *Australian controller of at least one
*Australian controlled foreign entity (not necessarily the
same Australian controlled foreign entity throughout that
period);

##### Section 820-305

(b) the entity is an *Australian entity that carries on a *business
at or through at least one *overseas permanent establishment
(not necessarily the same permanent establishment
throughout that period);

(c) the entity is:

(i) an Australian entity; and

(ii) an *associate entity of another entity that is an *outward
investing entity (non-ADI) or an *outward investing
entity (ADI) for that period.

Note: To determine whether an entity is an Australian controller of an
Australian controlled foreign entity, see Subdivision 820-H.

_Adjusted average equity capital_

(3) The entity’s adjusted average equity capital for an income year is:

(a) the average value, for that year, of all the *ADI equity capital
of the entity (other than ADI equity capital attributable to its
*overseas permanent establishments); minus

(b) the average value, for that year, of all the *controlled foreign
entity equity of the entity (other than controlled foreign entity
equity attributable to its overseas permanent establishments).

Note: To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see
Subdivision 820-G.

(4) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(a), treat treasury shares (within
the meaning of *accounting standard AASB 132) in the entity as
included in the *ADI equity capital of the entity, to the extent that
those shares are part of the entity’s eligible tier 1 capital (within the
meaning of the *prudential standards).

##### 820-305 Minimum capital amount

The entity’s minimum capital amount for an income year is the
least of the following amounts:

(a) the *safe harbour capital amount;

##### Section 820-310

Note: The entity cannot use the worldwide capital amount if the entity is
also a foreign controlled Australian entity throughout that year, see
section 820-320.

##### 820-310 Safe harbour capital amount

(1) The safe harbour capital amount is the result of applying the
method statement in this section.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of all
the entity’s:

(aa) *risk-weighted assets; and

(ab) intangible assets comprising capitalised software
expenses;

that are attributable to none of the following:

(a) the entity’s *overseas permanent establishments;

(b) assets comprised by the *controlled foreign entity
equity of the entity (other than controlled foreign
entity equity attributable to the entity’s overseas
permanent establishments);

(c) assets for which *prudential capital deductions
must be made by the entity (other than prudential
capital deductions attributable to the entity’s
overseas permanent establishments).

Step 2. Multiply the result of step 1 by 6%.

Step 3. Add to the result of step 2 the average value, for that
year, of all the *tier 1 prudential capital deductions for the
entity, to the extent that they are not attributable to:

General Part 4-5

Thin capitalisation rules Division 820

##### Section 820-310

(a) any of the entity’s *overseas permanent
establishments; or

(b) any *Australian controlled foreign entities of which
the entity is an *Australian controller; or

(c) any of the entity’s goodwill or intangible assets
which relate to the excess mentioned in
paragraph 5.3 of *accounting standard AASB
1038, as issued on 17 November 1998, to the
extent that the excess is referrable to *VBIF; or

Note: Paragraph 5.3 of that accounting standard applies to any
excess of the net market values of an interest in a
subsidiary over the net amount of that subsidiary’s assets
and liabilities.

(d) any of the entity’s intangible assets comprising
capitalised software expenses.

The result of this step is the safe harbour capital
**_amount._**

Example: The Southern Cross Bank is an Australian bank that carries on its
banking business through its overseas permanent establishments and
through foreign entities that it controls. For the income year, its
average value of risk-weighted assets and intangible assets comprising
capitalised software expenses is $150 million (having discounted
those assets that are excluded by step 1) and the average value of its
relevant tier 1 prudential capital deductions is $2 million. Multiplying
$150 million by 6% equals $9 million, which is the result of step 2.
Adding $2 million to $9 million equals $11 million, which is the safe
harbour capital amount.

(2) VBIF is the value of business in force at the time of acquisition of
the relevant subsidiary (within the meaning of paragraph 5.3 of
*accounting standard AASB 1038, as issued on 17 November
1998) of the entity.

(3) *VBIF is taken to be nil at all times unless the value of VBIF at the
time of acquisition of the relevant subsidiary was worked out by an
*actuary according to Australian actuarial practice.

##### Section 820-315

##### 820-315 Arm’s length capital amount

(1) The arm’s length capital amount is a notional amount that, having
regard to:

(a) the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2); and

(b) the relevant factors mentioned in subsection (3);

would represent the minimum amount of *equity capital that the
entity would reasonably be expected to have in carrying on the
Australian business mentioned in subsection (2) throughout the
income year if, throughout that year:

(c) the part of the entity carrying on that business had operated
as if it were a separate entity; and

(d) that separate entity had been dealing at *arm’s length with:

(i) the other part of the entity; and

(ii) all the *Australian controlled foreign entities of which
the entity is an *Australian controller.

Note: The entity must keep records in accordance with section 820-980 if
the entity works out an amount under this section.

_Factual assumptions_

(2) Irrespective of what actually happened during that year, the
following assumptions must be made in working out that minimum
amount:

(a) the entity’s commercial activities in connection with
Australia (the Australian business) during that year do not
include:

(i) any *business carried on by the entity at or through its
*overseas permanent establishments; or

(ii) the holding of any *controlled foreign entity equity;

(b) the entity had carried on the Australian business that it
actually carried on during that year;

(c) the nature of the entity’s assets and liabilities (to the extent
that they are attributable to the Australian business) had been
as they were during that year;

actually existed during that year.

_Relevant factors_

(3) On the basis of the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2),
the following factors must be taken into account in determining
that minimum amount:

(a) the functions performed, the assets used, and the risks
assumed, throughout that year, by:

(i) the entity; and

(ii) the entity in relation to the Australian business;

(b) the credit rating of the entity throughout that year, including
the effect of that credit rating on all of the following:

(i) the entity’s ability to borrow in relation to the
Australian business;

(ii) the interest rate at which the entity borrowed in relation
to that business;

(iii) the entity’s gross profit margin in relation to that
business;

(ii) the entity in relation to the Australian business;

(f) the commercial practices adopted by independent parties
dealing with each other at *arm’s length in the industry in
which the entity carries on the Australian business
throughout that year (whether in Australia or in comparable

the Australian business) throughout that year;

(h) the general state of the Australian economy throughout that
year;

(i) any other factors which are specified in the regulations made
for the purposes of this section.

_Commissioner’s power_

(4) If the Commissioner considers an amount worked out by the entity
under this section does not appropriately take into account the
factual assumptions and the relevant factors, the Commissioner
may substitute another amount that the Commissioner considers
better reflects those assumptions and factors.

##### 820-320 Worldwide capital amount

(1) This section only applies if the entity is not also a *foreign
controlled Australian entity throughout the income year.

(2) The worldwide capital amount is the result of applying the method
statement in this subsection.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of all
the *risk-weighted assets of the entity, other than
risk-weighted assets attributable to any of the following:

(a) the entity’s *overseas permanent establishments;

##### Section 820-320

(b) assets comprised by the *controlled foreign entity
equity of the entity;

(c) assets for which *prudential capital deductions
must be made by the entity.

Step 3. Multiply the result of step 1 by the entity’s worldwide
group capital ratio for that year (see subsection (3)).

Step 4. Add to the result of step 3 the average value, for that
year, of all the *tier 1 prudential capital deductions for the
entity (to the extent that they are not attributable to any of
the entity’s *overseas permanent establishments or to any
*Australian controlled foreign entities of which the entity
is an *Australian controller). The result of this step is the
**_worldwide capital amount._**

Example: Southern Cross Bank has an average value of risk-weighted assets of
$150 million (having discounted those risk-weighted assets that are
excluded by step 1) and the average value of its relevant tier 1
prudential capital deductions is $2 million. The entity’s worldwide
group capital ratio is 0.0875. Multiplying $150 million by 0.0875
equals $13.125 million, which is the result of step 3. Adding that
amount to the average value of the relevant tier 1 prudential capital
deductions equals $15.125 million, which is the worldwide capital
amount.

_Worldwide group capital ratio_

(3) The entity’s worldwide group capital ratio for the income year is
the result of applying the method statement in this subsection.

##### Section 820-325

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of the
tier 1 capital (within the meaning of the *prudential
standards) of the consolidated group of which the entity
is a member (within the meaning of those standards) in
accordance with those standards.

Step 2. Divide the result of step 1 by the average value, for that
year, of the *risk-weighted assets of that group in
accordance with the *prudential standards. The result is
the worldwide group capital ratio.

Example: For the Southern Cross Bank, the average value of the tier 1 capital for
the relevant consolidated group is $14 million. Dividing $14 million
by the group’s risk weighted assets of $160 million equals 0.0875,
which is the worldwide group capital ratio.

##### 820-325 Amount of debt deduction disallowed

The amount of *debt deduction disallowed under
subsection 820-300(1) is worked out using the following formula:

Capital shortfall
Debt deduction 
Average debt

where:

**_average debt means the average value, for the income year, of all_**
the *debt capital of the entity that gives rise to *debt deductions of
the entity for that or any other income year (other than any debt
capital that is attributable to any of the entity’s *overseas
permanent establishments).

**_capital shortfall means the amount by which the *adjusted average_**
equity capital of the entity for that year (see subsection 820-300(3))
is less than the entity’s *minimum capital amount for that year.

**_debt deduction means each *debt deduction covered by_**
subsection 820-300(1).

entity) if, for that period:

(a) the entity is an *outward investing entity (ADI); and

(b) the *adjusted average equity capital of the entity is less than
the entity’s *minimum capital amount.

Note: To determine whether an entity is an outward investing entity
(non-ADI) for that period, see subsection 820-300(2).

(2) The entity’s adjusted average equity capital for that period is:

(a) the average value, for that period, of all the *ADI equity
capital of the entity (other than ADI equity capital
attributable to any of its *overseas permanent
establishments); minus

(b) the average value, for that period, of all the *controlled

**Part 4-5 General**
**Division 820 Thin capitalisation rules**

##### Section 820-400

_Inward investing entity (ADI)_

(2) The entity is an inward investing entity **_(ADI) for a period that is_**
all or a part of an income year if, and only if, throughout that
period, the entity is a *foreign bank that carries on its banking
business in Australia at or through one or more of its *Australian
permanent establishments.

Note: The entity is required to keep certain records, see Subdivision 820-L.

_Average equity capital_

(3) The entity’s average equity capital for an income year is the sum
of the following:

(a) the average value, for that year, of the *ADI equity capital of
the entity that:

(i) is attributable to the *Australian permanent
establishments at or through which it carries on its
banking business in Australia; but

(ii) has not been allocated to the *OB activities of the
Australian permanent establishments;

(b) the average value, for that year, of the total amounts that:

(i) are made available by the entity to the Australian
permanent establishments of the entity as loans to the
Australian permanent establishments; and

(ii) do not give rise to any *debt deductions of the entity for
that or any other income year.

Note: To calculate an average value for the purposes of this Division, see
Subdivision 820-G.

##### 820-400 Minimum capital amount

The entity’s minimum capital amount for an income year is the
lesser of the following amounts:

(a) the *safe harbour capital amount;

(b) the *arm’s length capital amount.

General Part 4-5

Thin capitalisation rules Division 820

##### Section 820-405

##### 820-405 Safe harbour capital amount

The entity’s safe harbour capital amount for the income year is
the result of applying the method statement in this section.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the average value, for the income year, of that
part of the *risk-weighted assets of the entity that:

(a) is attributable to the *Australian permanent
establishments at or through which it carries on its
banking business in Australia; but

(b) is not attributable to the *OB activities of the
Australian permanent establishments.

Step 2. Multiply the result of step 1 by 6%. The result of this step
is the safe harbour capital amount.

Example: The Global Bank is a foreign bank that carries on its banking business
in Australia through a permanent establishment. The average value of
its relevant risk-weighted assets is $140 million. Multiplying that
amount by 6% results in $8.4 million, which is the safe harbour capital
amount.

##### 820-410 Arm’s length capital amount

(1) The arm’s length capital amount is a notional amount that, having
regard to:

(a) the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2); and

(b) the relevant factors mentioned in subsection (3);

would represent the minimum amount of *equity capital that the
entity would reasonably be expected to have in carrying on the
Australian business mentioned in subsection (2) throughout the
income year if, throughout that year:

(c) the part of the entity carrying on that business had operated
as if it were a separate entity; and

(d) that separate entity had been dealing at *arm’s length with the
other part of the entity.

Note: The entity must keep records in accordance with section 820-980 if
the entity works out an amount under this section.

_Factual assumptions_

(2) Irrespective of what actually happened during that year, the
following assumptions must be made in working out that minimum
amount:

(a) the entity’s commercial activities in connection with
Australia (the Australian business) during that year consist
only of banking business attributable to its *Australian
permanent establishments (other than its *OB activities);

(b) the entity had carried on the Australian business that it
actually carried on during that year;

(c) the nature of the entity’s assets and liabilities (to the extent
that they are attributable to the Australian business) had been
as they were during that year;

(d) except as mentioned in subsection (1), the entity had carried
on the Australian business in the same circumstances as what
actually happened during that year.

_Relevant factors_

(3) On the basis of the factual assumptions set out in subsection (2),
the following factors must be taken into account in determining
that minimum amount:

(a) the functions performed, the assets used, and the risks
assumed, throughout that year, by:

(i) the entity; and

(ii) the entity in relation to the Australian business;

(b) the credit rating of the entity throughout that year, including
the effect of that credit rating on all of the following:

(i) the entity’s ability to borrow in relation to the
Australian business;

better reflects those assumptions and factors.

##### 820-415 Amount of debt deduction disallowed

The amount of *debt deduction disallowed under
subsection 820-395(1) is worked out using the following formula:

Capital shortfall
Debt deduction 
Average debt

where:

**_average debt means the average value, for the income year, of all_**
the *debt capital of the entity that gives rise to *debt deductions of
the entity (other than *allowable OB deductions) for that or any
other income year.

**_capital shortfall means the amount by which the entity’s *average_**
equity capital for that year (see subsection 820-395(3)) is less than
the entity’s *minimum capital amount for that year.

**_debt deduction means each *debt deduction of the entity (other_**
than *allowable OB deduction) for the income year.

Note: The disallowed amount also does not form part of the cost base of a
CGT asset. See section 110-54.

##### 820-420 Application to part year periods

(1) This subsection disallows all or a part of each *debt deduction of
an entity for an income year that is an amount incurred by the
entity during a period that is a part of that year if, for that period:

(a) the entity is an *inward investing entity (ADI); and

(b) the entity’s *average equity capital is less than its *minimum
capital amount;

to the extent that the debt deduction:

(c) is attributable to an *Australian permanent establishment of
the entity at or through which it carries on its banking
business; and

Example: Austco Ltd is not a member of a consolidated group for the first 6
months of an income year, but then becomes the head company of a
consolidated group which continues in existence for the rest of the
income year.

For those first 6 months Austco is an outward investor (general) under
section 820-85. For the rest of the income year Austco is an outward
investor (general) under subsection 820-583(2).

This section ensures that section 820-120 (about part year periods)
applies to Austco instead of section 820-85, so that Subdivision 820-B
has 2 separate applications to Austco: one for the first 6 months and
the other for the rest of the income year. Under the second application,
account is taken of the position of the subsidiary members that are
taken to be part of Austco as head company of the consolidated group.

##### Section 820-588

of an income year, this Division (except this section) has effect as
if:

(a) none of the *members of the group were an *ADI at any time
in the period; and

(b) each member of the group that is an ADI (ignoring
paragraph (a)) at any time in the period were a financial
entity at that time.

Note 1: One result of this Division having effect in that way is that
Subdivision 820-D (and related provisions, such as section 820-589)
will not apply in relation to the head company, because:
(a) the head company of the group will not be classified under
section 820-583 as an outward investing entity (ADI); and

(b) section 820-587 will not apply that Subdivision.

Note 2: Another result of this Division having effect in that way is that
Subdivision 820-B or 820-C may apply in relation to the head
company, because it may be classified under section 820-583 as
either:
(a) an outward investing entity (non-ADI) and an outward investor
(financial); or

(b) an inward investing entity (non-ADI) and an inward investment
vehicle (financial).

(2) The conditions are that:

(a) at all times in the period at least one *member of the
*consolidated group or *MEC group is an *ADI; and

(b) each ADI that is a member of the group at any time in the
period is a *specialist credit card institution at that time; and

(c) the *head company of the group for the period chooses,
before lodging its *income tax return for the income year,
that this Division should have effect in that way in relation to
the group and every period for which the conditions in
paragraphs (a) and (b) are met in the income year.

(3) An *ADI is a specialist credit card institution at a time if, at that
time, the ADI’s authority under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959
to carry on banking business (as defined in that Act) authorises the
ADI to carry on only banking business that:

(ii) credit card issuing (as defined in those regulations).

(4) To avoid doubt, a choice for the purposes of paragraph (2)(c)

##### 820-589 How Subdivision 820-D applies to a MEC group

(1) This section has effect for the purposes of working out the
*adjusted average equity capital of the *head company of a *MEC
group for a period (the test period) that is all or part of an income
year if Subdivision 820-D applies to the head company in relation
to that period.

Note: Section 820-587 extends the application of Subdivision 820-D.

(2) The *head company’s *ADI equity capital at a particular time
during the test period is to be worked out:

(a) taking into account an *equity interest or *debt interest in the
head company only if it is held at that time by an entity that
is not a member of the group; and

(b) on the basis that an equity interest or debt interest in an
*eligible tier-1 company (other than the head company) that
is a member of the group at that time is treated as an equity
interest or debt interest (as appropriate) in the head company,
but only if it is held at that time by an entity that is not a
member of the group; and

(c) on the basis of the information that would be contained in a
set of consolidated accounts:

(i) prepared, in accordance with the *accounting standard
on consolidated accounts, as at that time; and

(ii) covering the members of the group as at that time.

##### Section 820-603

(3) In the case of a choice under section 820-597, this Division (except
Subdivision 820-FA, this Subdivision and Subdivision 820-L)
applies as if, at the test time, the *Australian permanent
establishment:

(a) had been part of the *head company; and

(b) had not been part of the establishment entity; and

(c) were a *subsidiary member of the *consolidated group or

(4) In the case of a choice under section 820-599, this Division (except

(a) the *Australian permanent establishment had been part of the

**Part 4-5 General**
**Division 820 Thin capitalisation rules**

##### Section 820-605

For the effects of disallowing debt deductions, see section 820-605.

(6) However, the application of this Division because of this section is
subject to the modifications set out in sections 820-607 to 820-615.

(7) For the purposes of this Division (as applying because of this
Subdivision), this Act (except this Division) applies as if the
matters referred to in subsections (3), (4) and (5) of this section
were the case.

Note: For example, this means that a head company is treated for the
purposes of this Division as if it had debt deductions based on the
actual costs incurred by an Australian permanent establishment while
it is treated as part of the head company because of this section.

##### 820-605 Effect on establishment entity if certain debt deductions disallowed

If:

(a) apart from this Division, a *debt deduction would be a
deduction of the establishment entity for an income year; and

(b) this Division (as applying because of this Subdivision)
disallows all or part of the deduction (treated as a deduction
of the *head company or single company);

this section disallows the deduction of the establishment entity, or
that part of it, as appropriate.

Note 1A: The disallowed amount also does not form part of the cost base of a
CGT asset. See section 110-54.

Note 1: This Division does not disallow a debt deduction that the
establishment entity incurs during the grouping period and that
consists of a cost that is:

-  attributable to an Australian permanent establishment covered by
the choice under section 820-597 or 820-599; and

-  paid or owed to the head company or single company.

The cost is not a debt deduction of the head company or single
company for the purposes of this Division as applying because of this
Subdivision. This is because subsection 820-603(3) or (4) treats the
Australian permanent establishment as being part of the head
company or single company, so the cost is treated as being paid or
owed by the head company or single company to itself.

General Part 4-5

Thin capitalisation rules Division 820

##### Section 820-607

Because subsection 820-603(3) or (4) also treats the Australian
permanent establishment as not being part of the establishment entity,
the cost is not a debt deduction of the establishment entity, so it is not
disallowed by this Division as applying to the establishment entity.

Note 2: This Division also does not disallow a debt deduction that the head
company or single company incurs during the grouping period and
that consists of a cost that is:

-  paid or owed to the establishment entity; and

-  is attributable to an Australian permanent establishment covered
by the choice under section 820-597 or 820-599.

The cost is not a debt deduction of the head company or single
company for the purposes of this Division as applying because of this
Subdivision. This is because subsection 820-603(3) or (4) treats the
Australian permanent establishment as being part of the head
company or single company, so the cost is treated as being paid or
owed by the head company or single company to itself.

##### 820-607 Effect on test periods under this Division

If, apart from this section, this Division (except this Subdivision)
would have a single application to the *head company or single
company, or to the establishment entity, in relation to a period (the
**_test period) that:_**

(a) is all or part of an income year of that entity; and

(b) overlaps the grouping period;

this Division (except this section) is to have separate applications
to that entity as follows:

(c) a single application in relation to the period of overlap; and

(d) a single application in relation to the part (if any) of the test
period that is before the period of overlap; and

(e) a single application in relation to the part (if any) of the test
period that is after the period of overlap.

##### 820-609 Effect on classification of head company or single company

(1) The *head company or single company is an outward investing
**_entity (ADI) for a period (the trial period) that is all or part of the_**
grouping period if:

(i) an *outward investing entity (non-ADI) and an *outward

(ii) an *outward investing entity (non-ADI) and an *outward

and at least one of the *Australian permanent establishments
is a *permanent establishment through which a *foreign bank
carries on banking *business in Australia.

(2) The *head company is also an outward investing entity (ADI) for
the trial period if, apart from this Subdivision:

(a) section 820-585 would prevent the disallowance of a *debt
deduction for the income year including the trial period; or

(b) section 820-587 would apply Subdivision 820-D to the head
company as if it were an *outward investing entity (ADI) for

#### How to calculate the average values

##### 820-630 Methods of calculating average values

_Methods of calculation for entities that are not ADIs_

(1) An entity to which Subdivision 820-B or 820-C applies for a
period that is all or a part of an income year must use one of the
following methods to calculate the average value of a matter
mentioned in that Subdivision for the purposes of that application:

(a) the method set out in section 820-635 (the opening and
**_closing balances method);_**

(b) the method set out in section 820-640 (the 3 measurement
**_days method);_**

(c) the method set out in section 820-645 (the frequent
**_measurement method)._**

Note 1: This subsection therefore applies only to an outward investing entity
(non-ADI) or an inward investing entity (non-ADI).

Note 2: An entity cannot apply the 3 measurement days method if it is unable
to meet the requirements in subsection 820-640(1). An entity’s ability
to apply that method may therefore be limited.

Note: This subsection therefore applies only to an outward investing entity
(ADI) or an inward investing entity (ADI).

##### 820-635 The opening and closing balances method

An entity that uses the opening and closing balances method for a
period must apply the following method statement to calculate the
average value of a matter for that period.

##### Section 820-645

Step 5. Divide the result of step 4 by 3. The result of this step is
the average value.

Example: RJ Corporation held assets valued at $115 million on the first day of
an income year. It held assets valued at $105 million on the last day of
the first half of that year, and $80 million on the last day of that year.
Adding these amounts and dividing the result by 3 gives the average
value of its assets for that year, which is $100 million.

_Measurement days_

(3) The following are the first, second and third measurement days:

(a) the first measurement day is the first day of the income year
if it occurs during that period, otherwise it is the first day of
that period;

(b) the second measurement day is the last day of the first half
of that year;

(c) the third measurement day is the last day of that year if it
occurs during that period, otherwise it is the last day of that
period.

##### 820-645 The frequent measurement method

(1) An entity that uses the frequent measurement method for a period
(the measurement period) must calculate the average value of a
matter for that period by applying:

(a) the method statement in subsection (2) (generally based on
quarterly periods); or

(b) the method statement in subsection (4) (generally based on
regular intervals).

This section does not prevent the entity from applying the method
statement in subsection (2) for one matter and the method

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the value of the particular matter as at each of
the following measurement days:

(a) the first day of the measurement period;

(b) the last day of each quarterly period of that income
year (see subsection (3)) that occurs during the
measurement period (if any);

(c) the last day of the measurement period if it is not a
day covered by paragraph (b).

Step 2. Add up those values.

Step 3. Divide the result of step 2 by the number of measurement
days. The result of this step is the average value.

Example: KJW Finance Corporation, a company that is an Australian entity,
held assets valued at $130 million on the first day of an income year.
On the last day of each quarterly period for that year it held assets
valued at $140 million, $120 million, $110 million and $100 million
respectively. Adding these amounts and dividing the result by 5 gives
the average value of its assets for that year, which is $120 million.

_Quarterly period_

(3) The quarterly periods of the income year are:

(a) the period consisting of the first, second and third months of
that year; and

(b) each successive period of 3 months that occurs after that
period during that year.

##### Section 820-645

(4) This is the method statement for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b):

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the value of the particular matter as at each of
the following measurement days:

(a) the first day of the measurement period;

(b) the last day of each regular interval for the
measurement period (see subsection (5));

(c) the last day of the measurement period if it is not a
day mentioned in paragraph (b).

Step 2. Add up those values.

Step 3. Divide the result of step 2 by the number of measurement
days. The result of this step is the average value.

Example: TW Corporation, a company that is an Australian entity, adopts a
weekly interval for the purposes of this subsection. The measurement
period is a period of 12 weeks. On the first day of that period it had
$70 million of debt capital. Its debt capital was $80 million on the last
day of each of the first 7 weeks, and $95 million on the last day of the
remaining 5 weeks. Adding these amounts and dividing the result by
13 (the number of measurement days) gives the average value of its
debt capital for that period, which is $85 million.

_Regular intervals_

(5) The regular intervals for the measurement period are:

(a) a period which consists of a fixed number of days or months
(not less than one day and not more than 3 months) adopted
by the entity and begins at the start of the first day of the
measurement period; and

(b) each successive period of the same duration that occurs
during the measurement period.

time is taken to hold, at that time, a *TC direct control
interest in the trust that is equal to 100%.

Note: The foreign entity therefore holds a TC control tracing interest in the
trust (see section 820-875). That interest may then be taken into
account in calculating any TC indirect control interest that the foreign
entity holds in another entity in relation to which the trust is an
interposed entity (see section 820-870). As a result, that other entity
may become a foreign controlled Australian entity.

##### 820-870 TC indirect control interest in a company, trust or partnership

_What is a TC indirect control interest?_

(1) An entity holds a thin capitalisation indirect control interest (or a
**_TC indirect control interest) in a company, trust or partnership at a_**
particular time if, and only if:

(a) there is an interposed entity, or a continuous series of at least
2 interposed entities, between that entity and the company,
trust or partnership; and

(b) the interposed entity, or each of the interposed entities, is:

(i) a *foreign controlled Australian entity if this section is
used for the purposes of determining whether or not an
entity is a foreign controlled Australian entity; or

(ii) an *Australian controlled foreign entity if this section is
used for the purposes of determining whether or not an
entity is an Australian controlled foreign entity or an
*Australian controller of such an entity.

Note: In the case of a continuous series of interposed entities between an
entity and a company, trust or partnership, the entity must hold a TC
control tracing interest in the first interposed entity (see
subsection (2)). In addition, under subsection (2), each interposed
entity in the series must hold a TC control tracing interest in the next

interposed entity (except in the case of the last one, which holds a TC
control tracing interest in the company, trust or partnership).

_What is an interposed entity?_

(2) For the purposes of this section, an entity (the middle entity) is
interposed between 2 other entities at a particular time if, and only
if, at that time:

(a) the first of those 2 entities holds a *TC control tracing interest
in the middle entity; and

(b) the middle entity holds a TC control tracing interest in the
second of those 2 entities.

Note: For the rules about a TC control tracing interest, see section 820-875.

_How to calculate a TC indirect control interest_

(3) The *TC indirect control interest that an entity (the top entity)
holds in a company, trust or partnership at a particular time is
calculated in accordance with subsection (4), (5) or (6) (as
appropriate).

_One interposed entity only_

(4) The *TC indirect control interest is the result of applying the
following method statement if there is only one interposed entity
between the top entity and the company, trust or partnership at that
time.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Calculate the *TC control tracing interest that the top
entity holds in the interposed entity at that time.

Step 2. Multiply the result of step 1 by the *TC control tracing
interest that the interposed entity holds in the company,
trust or partnership at that time.

(ii) each of the interests gives rise to a cost, at any time, that
is covered by paragraph 820-40(1)(a), but the cost is not
deductible from the assessable income of the issuer of
the interest for any income year.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), take into account the value of
an *equity interest in, or a *debt interest issued by, a *foreign entity
only to the extent that the interest is attributable to assets covered
by subparagraph (2)(b)(i) or (ii) that are held by the foreign entity
throughout the relevant period.

##### 820-920 Associate entity excess amount

(1) This section applies to an entity (the relevant entity) that is an
*outward investing entity (non-ADI) or an *inward investing entity
(non-ADI) for a period that is all or a part of an income year.

(2) The relevant entity’s associate entity excess amount at a particular
time during that period is the result of applying the method
statement in this subsection.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the premium excess amount (see
subsection (3)), as at that particular time, for an
*associate entity of the relevant entity that is the issuer of
an *equity interest or a *debt interest any value of which
is all or a part of the relevant entity’s *associate entity
equity at that time.

Step 2. Add to the result of step 1 the attributable safe harbour
excess amount (see subsection (4)) for that *associate
entity as at that time.

Step 3. Apply steps 1 and 2 to all such *associate entities of the
relevant entity and add all the results that are positive
amounts. The result of this step is the associate entity
**_excess amount._**

(3) An *associate entity’s premium excess amount at a particular time
during that period is the result of applying the method statement in
this subsection. In applying the method statement, disregard any
amount that is attributable to an entity’s *overseas permanent
establishments if it is an *outward investing entity (non-ADI) at
that time.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the value, as at that particular time, of all the
*associate entity equity of the relevant entity that is
attributable to the *associate entity (disregarding the
value of any *debt interest *issued by the associate entity
that is held by the relevant entity at that time).

Step 2. Work out the value, as at that time, of all the *equity
capital of the *associate entity that is attributable to
*equity interests that the relevant entity holds in the
associate entity at that time (except equity interests
whose value is all or a part of the relevant entity’s
*controlled foreign entity equity at that time).

Step 3. Reduce the result of step 1 by the result of step 2.
However, if the result of step 2 is a negative amount, the
result of step 2 is taken to be nil for the purpose of this
step.

Step 4. Multiply the result of step 3 by:

(a) 15/16 if the *associate entity excess amount is
applied for the purpose of working out the *total
debt amount of the relevant entity for that period
under subsection 820-100(2), 820-200(2) or

(d) the result of step 4 of the method statement in
subsection (1) or (2) of section 820-110 (as
appropriate) if the associate entity excess amount
is applied for the purpose of working out the
*worldwide gearing debt amount of the relevant
entity for that period.

The result of this step is the premium excess amount.

(4) The *associate entity’s attributable safe harbour excess amount at
a particular time during that period is the result of applying the
method statement in this subsection. In applying the method
statement, disregard any amount that is attributable to an entity’s
*overseas permanent establishments if it is an *outward investing

(a) an entity is a *foreign hybrid in relation to an income year;
and

(b) the entity is in existence at the start of the next income year;
and

(c) the entity is not a foreign hybrid in relation to that income
year (the post-hybrid year).

(2) For the purposes of applying an *asset-based income tax regime for
the post-hybrid year and each later income year in relation to
which the entity continues not to be a foreign hybrid, the *tax cost
is set at the start of the post-hybrid year, for each asset of the entity
at that time.

##### 830-90 What the expression tax cost is set means

The following table explains what the expression tax cost is set at
the start of the hybrid year or the post-hybrid year means, in
relation to an asset in which a partner has an interest or in relation

Foreign hybrids Division 830

##### Section 830-95

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out what would have been the entity’s *tax cost of
the asset for the purposes of applying the *asset-based
income tax regime as at the start of the hybrid year if it
were not a *foreign hybrid in relation to the hybrid year.

Step 2. Multiply the result of step 1 by:

(a) if the entity is a *foreign hybrid company in
relation to the hybrid year—the percentage
applicable to the partner under
subsection 830-35(2); or

(b) if the entity is a *foreign hybrid limited partnership
in relation to the hybrid year—the individual
interest of the partner in the asset, expressed as a
percentage of the interests of all of the partners in
the asset.

Step 3. If the partner paid a premium in respect of the
*acquisition of its interest in the asset (see
subsection (2)), add the amount of the premium to the
result of step 2. If the partner received a discount in
respect of the acquisition (see subsection (2)), subtract
the amount of the discount from the result of step 2, but
not to the extent that this would result in a negative
amount.

The result of step 3 is the partner’s tax cost setting
**_amount in respect of the asset._**

##### Section 830-95

(2) Work out whether the partner paid a premium or received a
discount for its interest in the asset using the following method
statement:

_Method Statement_

Step 1. Add up all the amounts paid by the partner before the
start of the hybrid year for its *shares in the entity (if the
entity was a company), or for its interests in the assets of
the entity and in the entity (if the entity was a *limited
partnership), that it held at the start of the hybrid year,
and subtract all amounts received by the partner in
respect of those shares or interests by way of reduction in
capital of the entity.

Step 2. Work out the amount that, if the capital of the entity had
been distributed to its *shareholders on a winding-up or
to its partners on a dissolution, at the end of the income
year before the hybrid year, the partner could reasonably
be expected to have received of the total distribution.

Step 3. If the result of step 1 exceeds the result of step 2, the
partner paid a premium for its interest in the asset. If the
result of step 2 exceeds the result of step 1, the partner
received a discount for its interest in the asset.

Step 4. Work out the amount of the premium or discount using
the formula:


Result of step 1 in the method

statement in subsection (1)


Excess mentioned in step 3


in the method statement

##### Section 830-100

(3) The entity’s tax cost setting amount for an asset at the start of the
post-hybrid year in relation to an *asset-based income tax regime is
equal to the sum of what the partners’ *tax costs for their interests
in the asset would be at that time for the purpose of applying the

The tax cost of a partner’s interest in an asset or of an asset of the
entity for the purposes of applying an *asset-based income tax
regime at the start of the post-hybrid year or the hybrid year is
worked out using the following table:

**Tax cost of an asset**


**Item** **If the asset-based income**
**tax regime is:**

1 Subdivisions 40-A to 40-D,
sections 40-425 to 40-445

##### 832-1 What this Division is about

A “hybrid mismatch” arises if double non-taxation results from the
exploitation of differences in the tax treatment of an entity or
financial instrument under the laws of 2 or more countries.

There is double non-taxation if a deductible payment is not
included in a tax base (this is called a deduction/non-inclusion
mismatch), or if a payment gives rise to 2 deductions (this is called
a deduction/deduction mismatch). Disallowing a deduction, or
including an amount in assessable income, “neutralises” this tax
advantage.

General Part 4-5

Hybrid mismatch rules Division 832

##### Section 832-30

##### 832-30 How this Division applies to entities

_Identifying payments between entities etc._

(1) A number of provisions in this Division refer to an entity making a
payment to another entity. In determining for the purposes of this
Division whether an entity makes or receives a payment, the
following are to be disregarded:

(a) subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule);

(b) Part IIIB of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936;

(c) any law of a foreign country that, for the purposes of a
foreign tax, treats a different entity as having made the
payment, or disregards the payment.

Note 1: The purpose of this subsection is to establish a uniform basis for
recognising “payments” between entities across all jurisdictions. (Note
that in some countries, a “payment” recognised by this subsection will
not have a tax consequence because the payment is disregarded for tax
purposes).

Note 2: As a consequence of paragraph (1)(a), a subsidiary member of a
consolidated group or MEC group may be a hybrid payer under
section 832-320 or a deducting hybrid under section 832-550 (it
cannot be a reverse hybrid because of
subparagraph 832-410(2)(b)(ii)).

(2) In addition, in the case of a trust or partnership, the trust or
partnership, instead of a trustee or partner, is taken, for the
purposes of this Division, to do the following things:

(a) make or receive a payment;

(b) hold, acquire or dispose of an asset, interest or other
property;

(c) enter into or carry out a *scheme or a part of a scheme.

_Identifying income or profits of entities_

(3) A number of provisions in this Division refer to the income or
profits of an entity. For the purposes of this Division, things
recognised in accordance with subsection (1) or (2) as being done

_Assessable income and deductions_

(4) A reference in this Division to an amount being included in the
assessable income of an entity, or being allowable, or not
allowable, as a deduction to an entity, is taken to be a reference to
an amount that is so included, or allowable or not allowable, as the
case requires, in determining:

(a) in the case of an entity that is a trust—the entity’s *net
income; or

(b) in the case of a partnership—the partnership’s net income or
*partnership loss.

_This section does not affect the interpretation of other provisions_

(5) Nothing in this section affects whether *tax or *foreign income tax
is imposed on an entity.

Subject to section 832-30, subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity
rule) is not disregarded in applying this Division.

##### 832-40 Schemes outside Australia

This Division applies in relation to a payment whether or not the
*scheme under which the payment is made has been or is entered
into or carried out in Australia or outside Australia or partly in
Australia and partly outside Australia.

##### 832-45 Relationship between this Division and other charging provisions in this Act

(1) This section applies if an amount is included in the assessable
income of an entity under a provision of this Division in relation to
a payment.

(2) An amount in relation to the payment that is to be included in the
assessable income of the entity under a provision (other than a
provision of this Division) is to be reduced to the extent (if any)
necessary to ensure that the total amount included in the entity’s
assessable income in relation to the payment does not exceed the
amount of the payment.

_Relationship with section 230-20_

(3) This section applies despite section 230-20 (about taxation of

##### 832-50 Relationship between this Division and Division 820

(1) In determining for the purposes of this Division whether a payment
gives rise to a deduction, and the amount of the deduction,
disregard the effect of Division 820 (about thin capitalisation).

(2) Nothing in this Division limits Division 820 (about thin
capitalisation) in its application to reduce, or further reduce, *debt
deductions of an entity.

##### 832-55 Division does not affect foreign residence rules

Nothing in this Division affects the operation of the provisions of
Division 6 that provide for the significance of foreign residence for
the assessability of ordinary and statutory income.

Note: Amounts included in assessable income under this Division may be
ordinary or statutory income for the purposes of Division 6.

##### Section 832-105

#### Operative provisions

##### 832-105 When a payment gives rise to a deduction/non-inclusion mismatch

_Australian deduction_

(1) If:

(a) a deduction (other than a deduction that is solely attributable
to a *currency exchange rate effect) is allowable to an entity
in an income year in respect of a payment (including a part or
share of the payment); and

(b) the amount of the deduction exceeds the sum of the amounts
of the payment that are:

(i) *subject to foreign income tax in a foreign country in a
*foreign tax period that starts no later than 12 months
after the end of the income year; or

(ii) *subject to Australian income tax for the income year;

then the deduction is the deduction component of a
**_deduction/non-inclusion mismatch to which the payment gives_**
rise.

Note: A deduction/non-inclusion mismatch might give rise to a hybrid
financial instrument mismatch (see Subdivision 832-C), a hybrid
payer mismatch (see Subdivision 832-D), a reverse hybrid mismatch
(see Subdivision 832-E), or a branch hybrid mismatch (see
Subdivision 832-F).

_Foreign income tax deduction_

(2) If:

(a) an entity is entitled to a *foreign income tax deduction in a
foreign country in a *foreign tax period in respect of a
payment (including a part or share of the payment); and

(b) the amount of the foreign income tax deduction exceeds the
sum of the amounts of the payment that are:

(i) *subject to foreign income tax in a foreign country in a
foreign tax period that starts no later than 12 months

after the end of the foreign tax period in which the
foreign income tax deduction arose; or

(ii) *subject to Australian income tax for an income year
that starts no later than 12 months after the end of the
foreign tax period in which the foreign income tax
deduction arose; and

(c) the foreign income tax deduction is not solely attributable to:

(i) any currency exchange rate fluctuations; or

(ii) a difference between an expressly or implicitly agreed
currency exchange rate for a future date or time and the
applicable currency exchange rate at that date or time;

then the foreign income tax deduction is the deduction component
of a deduction/non-inclusion mismatch to which the payment
gives rise.

_Amount of the deduction/non-inclusion mismatch_

(3) The amount of the *deduction/non-inclusion mismatch is the
amount of the excess worked out under paragraph (1)(b) or (2)(b),
as applicable.

##### 832-110 When a payment gives rise to a deduction/deduction mismatch

(1) A payment gives rise to a deduction/deduction mismatch if the
payment, or a part or share of the payment:

(a) gives rise to a *foreign income tax deduction in a foreign
country in a *foreign tax period; and

(b) also gives rise to:

(i) a deduction in an income year; or

(ii) a foreign income tax deduction in a foreign country
(other than the country mentioned in paragraph (a)).

Note: A deduction/deduction mismatch might give rise to a deducting hybrid
mismatch (see Subdivision 832-G).

(2) Each of the following is a deduction component of the
*deduction/deduction mismatch:

##### Section 832-110

(a) the *foreign income tax deduction mentioned in
paragraph (1)(a);

(b) the deduction mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(i), or the
foreign income tax deduction mentioned in
subparagraph (1)(b)(ii), as the case requires.

_Amount of the deduction/deduction mismatch_

(3) The amount of the *deduction/deduction mismatch is the lesser of:

(a) the amount of the *foreign income tax deduction mentioned
in paragraph (1)(a); and

(b) the sum of the amounts of the deduction, or foreign income
tax deduction, mentioned in subparagraph (1)(b)(i) or (ii).

_Extended operation in relation to non-payment deductions_

(4) This section applies in relation to the following amounts in the
same way as it applies in relation to a payment:

(a) an amount representing the decline in value of an asset;

(b) an amount representing a share in the net loss of a
partnership or other transparent entity.

(5) If:

(a) an amount representing a share in the net loss of a
partnership gives rise to a deduction; and

(b) in a foreign country:

(i) the same share in the income or profits of the
partnership forms part of the tax base of an entity under
a law of the foreign country dealing with *foreign
income tax (except a tax covered by
subsection 832-130(7)); but

(ii) that share is brought to account in that tax base on an
item-by-item basis, instead of on a net basis;

the amount is taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to also give
rise to a *foreign income tax deduction in the foreign country, for
an amount representing the share in the net loss of the partnership,

(6) For the purposes of subsection (4), a reference in this Division to
the *scheme under which a payment is made is taken to be a
reference to:

(a) if paragraph (4)(a) applies—the scheme under which the
asset is held; or

(b) if paragraph (4)(b) applies—the scheme under which the net
loss arose.

In determining for the purposes of this Division whether a payment
gives rise to a deduction, disregard the effect of this Division.

##### 832-120 Meaning of foreign income tax deduction

(1) An amount of a loss or outgoing is a foreign income tax deduction
in a foreign country in a *foreign tax period to which an entity is
entitled, if the entity is entitled to deduct the amount in working
out its tax base for the foreign tax period under a law of the foreign
country dealing with *foreign income tax (except a tax covered by
subsection 832-130(7)).

(2) To avoid doubt, an amount of a loss or outgoing may be a foreign

##### Section 832-125

subsection 832-130(7)) that has substantially the same effect
as foreign hybrid mismatch rules.

##### 832-125 Meaning of subject to Australian income tax

(1) An amount of income or profits is subject to Australian income
**_tax in an income year if it is an amount that is included in an_**
entity’s assessable income for the income year.

(2) However, if:

(a) the entity is a trust or partnership; and

(b) the trust or partnership has *net income for the income year;

then the amount is only subject to Australian income tax to the
extent it reasonably represents amounts:

(c) included in the assessable income of another entity for the
income year (other than an entity that is a partnership or a
trust); or

(d) for a trust—on which the trustee is liable to be assessed and
to pay *tax.

_Effect of CFC regimes_

(3) An amount of income or profits of an entity is subject to
**_Australian income tax if the amount is included under section 456_**
or 457 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in the assessable
income of another entity.

(4) In determining for the purposes of this Division whether an amount
of income or profits is *subject to Australian income tax, disregard
the effect of this Division, unless the contrary intention appears.

##### 832-130 Meaning of subject to foreign income tax

(1) An amount of income or profits is subject to foreign income tax in
a foreign country in a *foreign tax period if *foreign income tax
(except a tax covered by subsection (7)) is payable under a law of
the foreign country in respect of the amount because the amount is
included in the tax base of that law for the foreign tax period.

##### Section 832-130

Note: Subdivision 832-C (Hybrid financial instrument mismatch) has effect
as if certain amounts that are subject to a concessional rate of foreign
income tax were not subject to foreign income tax: see
section 832-235.

(2) To avoid doubt, an amount of income or profits may be subject to
**_foreign income tax in a foreign country in a *foreign tax period_**
even if the relevant entity’s tax base is nil, or a negative amount.

_Effect of credits etc. for underlying taxes_

(3) Despite subsection (1), if:

(a) an amount (the pre-credit amount) of income or profits
would, apart from this subsection, be *subject to foreign
income tax in a foreign country; and

(b) an entity is entitled under the law of the foreign country to a
credit, rebate or other tax concession in respect of the amount
for foreign tax (other than a withholding-type tax) payable
under a tax law of a different country (including Australia);

then only so much of the pre-credit amount as reasonably
represents an amount not effectively sheltered from *foreign
income tax (except a tax covered by subsection (7)) by the credit,
rebate or tax concession is subject to foreign income tax.

Note: This subsection is disregarded in working out whether an amount of
income or profits is dual inclusion income: see subsection 832-680(3).

_Effect of “dividend received deductions” in foreign countries_

(4) Despite subsection (1), if:

(a) an amount (the pre-deduction amount) of income or profits
would, apart from this subsection, be *subject to foreign
income tax in a foreign country; and

(b) the amount consists of a dividend received by an entity from
a company; and

(c) the entity is entitled to a *foreign income tax deduction in
respect of all or part of the amount of the dividend;

then only so much of the pre-deduction amount as reasonably
represents an amount not effectively sheltered from *foreign

_Act 1936 (including a tax base that is nil, or a negative amount)._

_Effect of foreign hybrid mismatch rules_

(6) In determining for the purposes of this section whether a payment
is included in a tax base of a law of a foreign country as mentioned
in subsection (1), disregard the effect of the following:

(a) any provisions of *foreign hybrid mismatch rules of a foreign
country;

(b) any provisions of another law of a foreign country relating to

##### Section 832-175

(a) a payment has any of the following effects:

(i) it gives rise to a deduction;

(ii) it gives rise to a *foreign income tax deduction;

(iii) it is *subject to Australian income tax;

(iv) it is *subject to foreign income tax; and

(b) for the purposes of this Division, the amount of one or more
such effects is to be translated under Subdivision 960-C into
an entity’s *applicable functional currency, or into Australian
currency;

then it is reasonable for the purposes of item 11A of the table in
subsection 960-50(6) (as modified by the regulations) to apply an
exchange rate to each translation so as best to achieve a consistent
measure of the extent to which the payment had each such effect.

Note: Item 11A is added to the table in subsection 960-50(6) by the

#### Subdivision 832-C—Hybrid financial instrument mismatch

#### Guide to Subdivision 832-C

##### 832-175 What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision neutralises a hybrid financial instrument
mismatch if it involves a deduction, or non-inclusion, in Australia.

A deduction/non-inclusion mismatch is a hybrid financial
instrument mismatch if it is attributable to hybridity in the
treatment of a financial instrument or an arrangement to transfer a
financial instrument, and either the relevant parties are related or
the mismatch arose under a structured arrangement.

There is also an integrity rule that covers payments that are made
in lieu of hybrid payments.

if:

(a) the payment gives rise to a *hybrid mismatch under
section 832-215 or 832-230; and

(b) subsection (3) or (6) applies.

Note: As a result of ordering rules in later Subdivisions, a payment that
gives rise to a hybrid financial instrument mismatch does not also give
rise to a hybrid mismatch under a later Subdivision of this Division.

mismatch is the *deduction component of the
*deduction/non-inclusion mismatch.

(3) This subsection applies if the following entities are related for the
purposes of subsection (4):

(a) the entity that made the payment;

(b) each entity that is a *liable entity in respect of the income or
profits of the recipient of the payment.

Note: For the definition of liable entity, see section 832-325.

##### 832-225 Hybrid requirement—payments under transfers of certain financial instruments

(1) A *deduction/non-inclusion mismatch, or a part of such a
mismatch, meets the hybrid requirement in this section if:

(a) the payment that gives rise to the mismatch is made under an
*arrangement covered by subsection 832-215(2); and

(b) the mismatch, or the part of the mismatch, is attributable to
differences in the treatment of the arrangement; and

##### Section 832-235

(iii) a *derivative financial arrangement; and

(c) the payment, or a part of the payment, (the substitute
**_payment) could reasonably be regarded as having been_**
converted into a form that is in substitution for a *return
(however described) on the interest or arrangement; and

(d) the return is covered by subsection (2).

(2) This subsection covers a *return (however described) on a *debt
interest, an *equity interest, or a *derivative financial arrangement,
that is transferred if any of the following apply:

(a) the return is made to the payer of the substitute payment, and
is not *subject to foreign income tax or *subject to Australian
income tax;

(b) the return is not made to the payer of the substitute payment,
but if it had been it would not have been subject to foreign
income tax or subject to Australian income tax;

(c) if the return were instead made to the payee of the substitute
payment:

(i) it would be subject to foreign income tax or subject to
Australian income tax; or

(ii) it would give rise to a *hybrid mismatch under
section 832-215.

_Amount of the hybrid mismatch_

(3) The amount of the *hybrid mismatch is the amount of the
*deduction/non-inclusion mismatch.

##### 832-235 Extended operation of this Subdivision in relation to concessional foreign taxes

(1) This section applies in working out, for the purposes of this
Subdivision, whether an amount is *subject to foreign income tax.

**Part 4-5 General**
**Division 832 Hybrid mismatch rules**

##### Section 832-240

(a) apart from this section, the amount would be *subject to
foreign income tax; and

(b) the rate of *foreign income tax (except a tax covered by
subsection 832-130(7)) (the lower rate) on the amount under
the law of the relevant foreign country is lower than the rate
(the ordinary rate) that would ordinarily be imposed on
interest income derived by an entity of that kind in the
foreign country.

_Amount of a deduction/non-inclusion mismatch_

(3) However, for the purposes of working out the amount of a
*deduction/non-inclusion mismatch that is affected by this section,
the amount of a payment that is treated by this section as not being
*subject to foreign income tax is to be discounted by multiplying it
by the following fraction:

Lower rate

Ordinary rate

where:

**_lower rate means the lower rate mentioned in paragraph (2)(b)._**

**_ordinary rate means the ordinary rate mentioned in_**
paragraph (2)(b).

##### 832-240 Adjustment if hybrid financial instrument payment is income in a later year

(1) There is an adjustment under this section for an entity in an income
year (the adjustment year) if:

(a) an amount was not allowable as a deduction for the entity in
an earlier income year under section 832-180 in respect of a
payment that gave rise to a *hybrid financial instrument
mismatch; and

(b) an amount (the taxed amount) of the payment is:

##### Section 832-280

(i) *subject to foreign income tax in a foreign country in a
*foreign tax period that ends within 12 months after the
end of the adjustment year; or

(ii) *subject to Australian income tax in the adjustment year.

(2) The taxed amount is an amount the entity can deduct in the
adjustment year.

(2A) Subsection (2) does not apply if, on the assumption that
subsections 832-180(2) and 832-725(6) were disregarded, no
amount would have been allowable as a deduction in respect of the
payment because of subsection 832-725(3).

(3) The total amounts deducted under this section in respect of a
payment must not exceed the amount that was not allowable as a
deduction in respect of the payment as mentioned in
paragraph (1)(a).

_No adjustment for concessional taxes_

(4) This section does not apply if the *hybrid mismatch would not have
arisen apart from section 832-235.

#### Subdivision 832-D—Hybrid payer mismatch

#### Guide to Subdivision 832-D

##### 832-280 What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision neutralises a hybrid payer mismatch if it involves
a deduction, or non-inclusion, in Australia.

A deduction/non-inclusion mismatch is a hybrid payer mismatch if
it is made by a hybrid payer, and the mismatch would not have
arisen, or would have been less, if the payment had instead been
made by an ungrouped entity. It is also a requirement that the
relevant parties are in the same control group or the mismatch
arose under a structured arrangement.

**Part 4-5 General**
**Division 832 Hybrid mismatch rules**

##### Section 832-285

An entity is a hybrid payer if a payment it makes is disregarded for
the purposes of the tax law of one country (resulting in
non-inclusion), but is deductible for the purposes of the tax law of
another country.

The neutralising amount for the hybrid payer mismatch is reduced
by dual inclusion income.

A hybrid payer mismatch that is not neutralised by this Subdivision
(or by foreign hybrid mismatch rules) is an offshore hybrid
mismatch, which might give rise to an imported hybrid mismatch
under Subdivision 832-H.

##### Section 832-290

(b) the deduction is the *deduction component of a *hybrid payer
mismatch to which the payment gives rise.

(2) So much of the deduction as does not exceed the *neutralising
amount for the *hybrid payer mismatch is not allowable as a
deduction.

Note: The neutralising amount is worked out under section 832-330.

##### 832-290 Inclusion in assessable income—Australian secondary response

(1) This section applies to an entity if:

(a) the entity is the recipient of a payment that gives rise to a
*hybrid payer mismatch; and

(b) the *deduction component of the mismatch is a *foreign
income tax deduction; and

(c) the secondary response is required (see subsection (2)).

_When secondary response is required_

(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(c), the secondary response is
required unless, in the country in which the *foreign income tax
deduction arose, the mismatch is covered by *foreign hybrid
mismatch rules that correspond to this Subdivision, or by a law that
has substantially the same effect as foreign hybrid mismatch rules
that correspond to this Subdivision.

_Inclusion of amount in assessable income_

(3) An amount equal to the *neutralising amount for the *hybrid payer
mismatch is included in the entity’s assessable income for the
income year mentioned in subsection (4). The assessable income is
taken to have been derived from the same source as the payment.

(4) The income year (the inclusion year) is:

(a) if the *foreign tax period in which the *foreign income tax
deduction arises falls wholly within an income year of the
entity—that income year; or

(1) A *hybrid payer mismatch is an offshore hybrid mismatch if:

(a) the *deduction component of the mismatch is a *foreign
income tax deduction; and

(b) no amount becomes *subject to Australian income tax as a
result of the application of section 832-290 in relation to the
mismatch; and

(c) the mismatch is not covered by *foreign hybrid mismatch
rules that correspond to this Subdivision, or by a law that has
substantially the same effect as foreign hybrid mismatch
rules that correspond to this Subdivision.

Note: An offshore hybrid mismatch might give rise to an imported hybrid
mismatch: see Subdivision 832-H.

(2) The amount of the *offshore hybrid mismatch is the *neutralising
amount for the *hybrid payer mismatch.

##### 832-305 When a payment gives rise to a hybrid payer mismatch

profits of a company (regardless whether the foreign
income tax is actually imposed on that entity, or another
entity).

Note 1: The entity, and its income or profits, are generally identified
disregarding tax provisions: see section 832-30.

Note 2: An example is an entity that is a company (and is not a subsidiary
member of a consolidated group or MEC group). In Australia, a
company is the liable entity in respect of its income or profits.

_Entity is a taxpayer in respect of another entity’s income or profits_

(2) An entity is a liable entity, in a country, in respect of the income or
profits of another entity (the test entity) if:

(a) for Australia—*tax is imposed on the entity in respect of all
or part of the income or profits of the test entity for an
income year; and

(b) for a foreign country—*foreign income tax (except a tax
covered by subsection 832-130(7)) is imposed under the law
of the foreign country on the entity in respect of all or part of
the income or profits of the test entity for a *foreign tax
period.

Note 1: The test entity, and its income or profits, are generally identified
disregarding tax provisions: see section 832-30.

Note 2: An example is a test entity that is a partnership. In Australia, each
partner in the partnership is a liable entity in respect of the income or
profits of the partnership.

(2A) However, an entity is not a liable entity in a country in respect of
the income or profits of a test entity under subsection (2) if the test
entity is the liable entity in that country in respect of the income or
profits as a result of the operation of subparagraph (1)(a)(ii), (a)(iii)
or (b)(ii).

(3) To avoid doubt, the following outcomes may arise under
subsection (2) in a country:

(a) there may be one or more *liable entities in respect of the
income or profits of a test entity;

_income tax_

(4) To avoid doubt, an entity may be a *liable entity in respect of its
own, or another entity’s, income or profits in a country even if any
of the following situations exist:

(a) there are no actual income or profits;

(b) there are income or profits, but no part of the income or
profits is:

(i) for Australia—*subject to Australian income tax; or

(ii) for a foreign country—*subject to foreign income tax in
that foreign country;

(c) the entity is not actually liable to pay an amount of *tax or
*foreign income tax.

Note: In determining whether an entity is a liable entity in such a situation,
assume that income or profits within the tax base of the country exist.

_Effect of CFC regimes_

(5) An entity is not a liable entity in respect of income or profits of
another entity (the test entity) merely because all or part of the
income or profits of the test entity are:

(a) included under section 456 or 457 of the Income Tax
_Assessment Act 1936 in the assessable income of the other_
entity; or

(b) included under a corresponding provision of a law of a
foreign country in working out the tax base of the other entity
(including a tax base of nil, or a negative amount).

##### Section 832-375

allowable as a deduction is an amount the entity can deduct in the
adjustment year.

(3) For the purposes of a later application of this section, treat the
amount that was not allowable as a deduction under
section 832-285 as being reduced by the amount deducted under
subsection (2) of this section.

#### Subdivision 832-E—Reverse hybrid mismatch

#### Guide to Subdivision 832-E

##### 832-375 What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision neutralises a reverse hybrid mismatch if it
involves a deduction in Australia.

A deduction/non-inclusion mismatch is a reverse hybrid mismatch
if it is made directly or indirectly to a reverse hybrid, and the
mismatch would not have arisen, or would have been less, if the
payment had instead been made directly to an investor in the
reverse hybrid.

An entity is a reverse hybrid if it is transparent for the purposes of
the tax law of the country in which it is formed, but
non-transparent for the purposes of the tax law of the country in
which investors in it are subject to tax (resulting in non-inclusion).

A reverse hybrid mismatch that is not neutralised by this
Subdivision (or by foreign hybrid mismatch rules) is an offshore
hybrid mismatch, which might give rise to an imported hybrid
mismatch under Subdivision 832-H.

##### Section 832-450

#### Subdivision 832-F—Branch hybrid mismatch

#### Guide to Subdivision 832-F

##### 832-450 What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision neutralises a branch hybrid mismatch if it
involves a deduction in Australia (and the non-inclusion was not
also in Australia).

A deduction/non-inclusion mismatch is a branch hybrid mismatch
if it is made directly or indirectly to a branch hybrid, and the
mismatch would not have arisen, or would have been less, if the
residence country had not recognised the permanent establishment.

An entity is a branch hybrid in relation to a payment made to it if,
for the purposes of the tax law of the country in which it is a
resident, the payment is treated as being allocated to a permanent
establishment in another country, but in the other country, the
payment is treated as not being allocated to a permanent
establishment in that country.

A branch hybrid mismatch that is not neutralised by this
Subdivision (or by foreign hybrid mismatch rules) is an offshore
hybrid mismatch, which might give rise to an imported hybrid
mismatch under Subdivision 832-H.

#### Subdivision 832-G—Deducting hybrid mismatch

#### Guide to Subdivision 832-G

##### 832-525 What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision neutralises a deducting hybrid mismatch if it
involves a deduction in Australia.

A deduction/deduction mismatch is generally a deducting hybrid
mismatch.

An entity is a deducting hybrid if a payment it makes is deductible
for the purposes of the tax law of 2 countries.

However, unless the deducting hybrid is a dual resident, there are
rules identifying which country is the primary response country. If
Australia is not the primary response country, this Subdivision will
not neutralise the deducting hybrid mismatch unless:

(a) the primary response country does not have hybrid
mismatch rules; and

(b) the relevant parties are in the same control group, or the
mismatch arose under a structured arrangement.

The neutralising amount for the deducting hybrid mismatch is
reduced by dual inclusion income.

A deducting hybrid mismatch that is not neutralised by this
Subdivision (or by foreign hybrid mismatch rules) is an offshore
hybrid mismatch, which might give rise to an imported hybrid
mismatch under Subdivision 832-H.

##### Section 832-545

(a) the only *deduction components of the mismatch are *foreign
income tax deductions; and

(b) the mismatch is not covered by *foreign hybrid mismatch
rules that correspond to this Subdivision, or by a law that has
substantially the same effect as foreign hybrid mismatch
rules that correspond to this Subdivision, in any country in
which a foreign income tax deduction arose.

Note: An offshore hybrid mismatch might give rise to an imported hybrid
mismatch: see Subdivision 832-H.

(2) The amount of the *offshore hybrid mismatch is the *neutralising
amount for the *deducting hybrid mismatch.

##### 832-545 When an amount gives rise to a deducting hybrid mismatch

(1) A payment or other amount gives rise to a deducting hybrid
**_mismatch if there is a *deducting hybrid in relation to the payment_**
or other amount.

(2) Each *deduction component of the *deduction/deduction mismatch
mentioned in paragraph 832-550(a) is a deduction component of
the *deducting hybrid mismatch.

(3) A *deducting hybrid mismatch is also a hybrid mismatch.

_Ordering rule_

(4) However, a payment does not give rise to a deducting hybrid
**_mismatch if it gives rise to a *hybrid financial instrument_**
mismatch, a *hybrid payer mismatch, a *reverse hybrid mismatch
or a *branch hybrid mismatch.

##### 832-550 Deducting hybrid

An entity is a deducting hybrid in relation to a payment or other
amount if:

(a) the payment or other amount gives rise to a
*deduction/deduction mismatch; and

##### Section 832-555

(b) the entity is:

(i) for a payment—the entity that makes the payment; or

(ii) for an amount that represents the decline in value of a
depreciating asset (see paragraph 832-110(4)(a))—the
entity that holds the asset; or

(iii) for an amount that represents a share in the net loss of a
partnership or other transparent entity (see
paragraph 832-110(4)(b))—an entity that has an interest
in the partnership or other transparent entity; and

(c) the entity:

(i) is a *liable entity in one deducting country (but not
both); or

(ii) satisfies the residency test in subsection 832-555(9) in
both deducting countries, and is also a liable entity in
both deducting countries; or

(iii) is a *member of a *consolidated group or a *MEC group.

##### 832-555 Identifying a secondary response country

(1) This section applies if an amount gives rise to a *deducting hybrid
mismatch, other than a deducting hybrid mismatch covered by
subsection (2).

_Dual residents—no secondary response_

(2) This subsection covers a *deducting hybrid mismatch if:

(a) the only *liable entity in respect of income or profits of the
*deducting hybrid is the deducting hybrid; and

(b) the liable entity satisfies the residency test in subsection (9)
in both deducting countries.

Note 1: For the meaning of liable entity, see section 832-325.

Note 2: If the deducting hybrid is a dual resident, the mismatch may be
neutralised by any country.

##### Section 832-555

_Country is a primary response country unless this section provides_
_otherwise_

(3) A country in which the amount gives rise to a deduction or *foreign
income tax deduction (a deducting country) is a primary response
country in relation to the *deducting hybrid mismatch unless the
country is identified as the secondary response country under
subsection (4), (5), (6), (7) or (8).

_Both countries recognise the same liable entity—residence country_
_is secondary response_

(4) If:

(a) the *deducting hybrid is itself the *liable entity in each
deducting country; and

(b) in one deducting country, the deducting hybrid does not
satisfy the residency test in subsection (9); and

(c) in the other deducting country, the deducting hybrid does
satisfy the residency test;

then the country mentioned in paragraph (b) is the secondary
response country.

(5) If:

(a) in both deducting countries, the same entity is the *liable
entity in respect of the income or profits of the *deducting
hybrid; and

(b) in one deducting country, the liable entity does not satisfy the
residency test in subsection (9); and

(c) in the other deducting country, the liable entity does satisfy
the residency test;

then the country mentioned in paragraph (b) is the secondary
response country.

(a) the *liable entity for one deducting country is a different
entity to the entity that is the liable entity for the other
deducting country; and

(b) in one deducting country, the *deducting hybrid is the liable
entity;

then the country mentioned in paragraph (b) is the secondary

(7) If:

(a) the *liable entity for one deducting country is a different
entity to the entity that is the liable entity for the other
deducting country; and

(b) the *deducting hybrid is not the liable entity in either country;
and

(c) in one deducting country, the entity that is a liable entity is
also a liable entity in respect of the income or profits of the
entity that is the liable entity in the other deducting country;

then the country mentioned second in paragraph (c) is the
secondary response country.

(8) If:

(a) the *liable entity for one deducting country is a different
entity to the entity that is the liable entity for the other
deducting country; and

(b) subsections (6) and (7) do not apply; and

##### Section 832-560

(i) the entity is a resident of the foreign country for the
purposes of the law of the foreign country relating to
*foreign income tax (except a tax covered by
subsection 832-130(7)); or

(ii) the tax base of the entity, as it relates to foreign income
tax (except a tax covered by subsection 832-130(7)),
includes income from worldwide sources.

##### 832-560 Neutralising amount

(1) The neutralising amount for a *deducting hybrid mismatch is
worked out by:

(a) starting with the lesser of the amounts of each deduction or
*foreign income tax deduction to which the amount gives
rise; and

(b) reducing (but not below nil) the result from paragraph (a) by
the amount of any *dual inclusion income that is available to
be applied in working out the neutralising amount.

_Australian deduction—inclusions must be in Australia and in the_
_other deducting country_

(2) An amount of *dual inclusion income is available to be applied to
reduce the *neutralising amount for a *deducting hybrid mismatch
to which section 832-530 applies if:

(a) the *deducting hybrid is eligible to apply the amount (see
subsection 832-680(7)); and

(b) the amount is *subject to Australian income tax for the
purposes of subsection 832-680(1) in the income year
mentioned in subsection 832-530(1); and

(c) the amount is *subject to foreign income tax for the purposes
of subsection 832-680(1) in the foreign country in which the
*foreign income tax deduction arose.

Note: Section 832-680 modifies the meanings of subject to Australian
income tax and subject to foreign income tax for the purpose of
working out dual inclusion income.

(3) An amount of *dual inclusion income is available to be applied to
reduce the *neutralising amount for a *deducting hybrid mismatch
that is an *offshore hybrid mismatch if:

(a) the *deducting hybrid is eligible to apply the amount (see
subsection 832-680(7)); and

(b) the amount is *subject to foreign income tax for the purposes
of subsection 832-680(1) in the foreign country in which one
of the *foreign income tax deductions arose, and in the same
*foreign tax period; and

(c) the amount is also subject to foreign income tax for the
purposes of subsection 832-680(1) in the foreign country in
which another of the foreign income tax deductions arose.

##### 832-565 Adjustment if deducting hybrid has dual inclusion income in a later year

(1) There is an adjustment under this section for an entity in an income
year (the adjustment year) if:

(a) in an earlier income year, all or part of a deduction of the
entity in respect of an amount that gave rise to a *deducting
hybrid mismatch was not allowable under section 832-530;
and

(b) an amount of *dual inclusion income is:

(i) available to be applied by the *deducting hybrid in the
adjustment year; and

(ii) *subject to Australian income tax for the purposes of
subsection 832-680(1) in the adjustment year; and

(iii) *subject to foreign income tax for the purposes of
subsection 832-680(1) in the foreign country in which
the *foreign income tax deduction arose.

allowable as a deduction is an amount the entity can deduct in the
adjustment year.

(2A) Subsection (2) does not apply if:

(a) the amount that was not allowable as a deduction under
section 832-530 relates to a payment; and

(b) on the assumption that subsection 832-530(2) were
disregarded, no amount would have been allowable as a
deduction in respect of the payment because of
subsection 832-725(3).

(3) For the purposes of a later application of this section, treat the
amount that was not allowable as a deduction under
section 832-530 as being reduced by the amount deducted under
subsection (2) of this section.

#### Subdivision 832-H—Imported hybrid mismatch

#### Guide to Subdivision 832-H

##### 832-605 What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision neutralises an imported hybrid mismatch. This
mismatch is an integrity rule that applies when one or more entities
are interposed between a hybrid mismatch and a country that has
hybrid mismatch rules.

Identifying an imported hybrid mismatch involves testing whether
a hybrid mismatch involving 2 foreign countries has been
“imported” into Australia by a deduction. If so, there are priority
rules that allocate the neutralisation of the mismatch between
countries that have hybrid mismatch rules.

##### Section 832-620

##### 832-620 Hybrid mismatch

(1) A payment gives rise to a hybrid mismatch if the payment is an
*importing payment in relation to an *offshore hybrid mismatch.

Note: For the meaning of offshore hybrid mismatch see sections 832-195,
832-300, 832-390, 832-465, and 832-540.

_Ordering rule_

(2) A payment does not give rise to a hybrid mismatch under this
section if it gives rise to a *hybrid financial instrument mismatch, a
*hybrid payer mismatch, a *reverse hybrid mismatch, a *branch
hybrid mismatch or a *deducting hybrid mismatch.

Note: However, for an imported hybrid mismatch to arise, a different
payment must have given rise to an offshore hybrid mismatch that is
of one of these kinds.

##### 832-625 Meaning of importing payment

(1) A payment an entity (the payer) makes is an importing payment in
relation to an *offshore hybrid mismatch if:

(a) either:

(i) apart from section 832-610, the payment, or a part of the
payment, gives rise to a deduction in an income year
covered by subsection (2); or

(ii) the payment, or a part of the payment, gives rise to a
*foreign income tax deduction in a foreign country that
has *foreign hybrid mismatch rules, in a *foreign tax
period covered by subsection (2); and

(b) the payment is made directly, or indirectly through one or
more interposed entities, to another entity; and

(c) the other entity (the offshore deducting entity) is:

(i) the entity that made the payment that gave rise to the
offshore hybrid mismatch; or

(ii) if the offshore hybrid mismatch is a *deducting hybrid
mismatch—the *deducting hybrid.

##### Section 832-625

_Period within which mismatch may be imported_

(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), a *foreign tax period or
income year is covered by this subsection if:

(a) it ends at or after the end of the foreign tax period in which a
*deduction component of the *offshore hybrid mismatch
arose; and

(b) it has at least one day in common with that period.

_Indirect importations_

(3) For the purposes of determining whether a payment is made
indirectly through one or more interposed entities to the offshore
deducting entity:

(a) it is sufficient if payments exist between each interposed
entity, and it is not necessary to demonstrate that each
payment in a series of payments funds the next payment, or is
made after the previous payment; and

(b) each payment made by an interposed entity must:

(i) give rise to a *foreign income tax deduction in a country
that does not have *foreign hybrid mismatch rules; and

(ii) not give rise to a *deduction/non-inclusion mismatch.

_Loss surrender and grouping relief_

(4) Subsection (5) applies if:

(a) a payment is made to an entity (the first entity); and

(b) another entity (the second entity) makes a payment (the
**_second payment) to a third entity; and_**

(c) the first entity and the second entity are in the same

(ii) the foreign income tax deduction may, as a result of a
concessional feature of that law, be transferred to,
shared with, or otherwise applied by, the first entity.

Note: For the meaning of Division 832 control group, see section 832-205.

(5) For the purposes of this section, treat:

(a) a payment as having been made by the first entity to the
second entity; and

(b) the payment as having given rise to a *foreign income tax
deduction (but not a *deduction/non-inclusion mismatch) in
the foreign country mentioned in paragraph (4)(d).

##### 832-630 Working out the amount of the imported hybrid mismatch

(1) The amount of the *imported hybrid mismatch is the lesser of:

(a) the importing deduction amount worked out under
subsection (2) in relation to the deduction; and

(b) the amount worked out using the following formula:


Importing deduction Remaining offshore


Total importing deductions of equal priority hybrid mismatch

where:

**_importing deduction means the amount of the importing deduction_**
amount worked out under subsection (2) in relation to the
deduction.

**_remaining offshore hybrid mismatch means:_**

(a) unless paragraph (b) applies—the amount of the *offshore
hybrid mismatch; or

(b) if an item higher in the table in subsection 832-615(2) applies
to one or more other *importing payments in relation to the
offshore hybrid mismatch—the amount of the offshore
hybrid mismatch that is not, or will not be, neutralised by the
application of this Subdivision, and equivalent provisions of
applicable *foreign hybrid mismatch rules, in relation to
those other importing payments.

this subsection in relation to a deduction or *foreign income tax
deduction is:

(a) if the *importing payment is made directly to the offshore
deducting entity—the amount of the deduction or foreign
income tax deduction; or

(b) if the importing payment is made indirectly through one or
more interposed entities to the offshore deducting entity—the
lesser of:

(i) the amount of the deduction or foreign income tax
deduction; and

#### Subdivision 832-I—Dual inclusion income

#### Guide to Subdivision 832-I

##### 832-675 What this Subdivision is about

Income that is taxed in 2 countries is dual inclusion income. It can
be applied to reduce the neutralising amount for the hybrid payer
mismatch and the deducting hybrid mismatch.

This Subdivision modifies the concepts of “subject to Australian
income tax” and “subject to foreign income tax” for the purposes
of calculating dual inclusion income.

It also identifies which entities are able to apply dual inclusion
income.

##### Section 832-680

#### Operative provisions

##### 832-680 Dual inclusion income, and when an entity is eligible to apply it

(1) An amount of income or profits is dual inclusion income if 2 or
more of the following outcomes arise for the amount:

(a) it is *subject to Australian income tax in an income year;

(b) it is *subject to foreign income tax in a foreign country in a
*foreign tax period;

(c) it is subject to foreign income tax in a foreign country (other
than the country mentioned in paragraph (b)) in a foreign tax
period.

Note: In certain circumstances, dual inclusion income can be applied to
reduce the neutralising amount for a hybrid payer mismatch (see
section 832-330) or a deducting hybrid mismatch (see
section 832-560).

(1A) In determining for the purposes of subsection (1) whether an
amount of income or profits is *subject to Australian income tax,
disregard subsection 832-125(2) (which is about when an amount
included in the assessable income of a trust or partnership is
subject to Australian income tax), so far as it applies in relation to
assessable income from a foreign source.

_Effect of Australian foreign income tax offset for underlying taxes_

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), if:

(a) an amount of assessable income of a *corporate tax entity
(the assessable amount) would, apart from this subsection
and subsection (1A), be *subject to Australian income tax;
and

(b) an amount of *foreign income tax (except a tax covered by
subsection 832-130(7)) paid in respect of the assessable
amount counts towards a *tax offset for an entity under
Division 770;

(c) if the amount of the tax offset equals or exceeds the amount
of *tax that would, having regard only to the assessable
amount and the rate at which tax is imposed on the entity, be
payable on the assessable amount—the assessable amount is
treated as if it were not subject to Australian income tax; and

(d) if the amount of the tax offset is a proportion of the amount
of that tax—then that proportion of the assessable amount is
treated as if it were not subject to Australian income tax.

_Effect of credits etc. for underlying taxes_

(3) In determining for the purposes of subsection (1) whether an
amount of income or profits is *subject to foreign income tax in a
*foreign tax period, disregard subsection 832-130(3).

Hybrid mismatch rules Division 832

##### Section 832-680

(4A) In determining whether paragraph (4)(d) is satisfied, have regard to
any previous application of subsection (5).

(5) For the purposes of subsection (1), the on-payment amount is
treated as if it were:

(a) if the country mentioned in paragraph (4)(a) is Australia—
*subject to Australian income tax in the income year in which
the time mentioned in paragraph (4)(b) occurs; or

(b) if the country mentioned in paragraph (4)(a) is a foreign
country—*subject to foreign income tax in the foreign
country in the *foreign tax period in which the time
mentioned in paragraph (4)(b) occurs.

(6) Two or more entities (the member entities) are members of a group
(a dual inclusion income group) in a country for the purposes of
this Division if in that country:

(a) the same entity or entities are *liable entities in respect of the
income or profits of each of the member entities; and

(b) no other entity is a liable entity in respect of the income or
profits of any of the member entities.

Note: For example, entities that are members of a consolidated group or
MEC group.

_When an entity is eligible to apply dual inclusion income_

(7) An entity is eligible to apply an amount of *dual inclusion income
if the amount is income or profits of:

(a) the entity; or

(b) if paragraph (a) does not apply and the entity is a member of
a dual inclusion income group in any country—an entity that
is a member of the dual inclusion income group.

(8) However, an entity is not eligible to apply the amount if it has
already been applied by any entity by a previous application of a
provision of this Division.

##### Section 832-720

_Interaction with other provisions_

(9) To avoid doubt, if a provision of this section has the effect that an
amount is treated for the purposes of subsection (1) as if it were
*subject to Australian income tax, or *subject to foreign income
tax, then that effect extends to another provision of this Act that
refers to an amount that is (as the case requires):

(a) subject to Australian income tax for the purposes of
subsection (1) of this section; or

(b) subject to foreign income tax for the purposes of
subsection (1) of this section.

Note: For example, an amount that would not be subject to Australian
income tax for the purposes of subsection (1) apart from
subsection (1A) satisfies paragraphs 832-330(2)(b) and (3)(b) and
subparagraph 832-335(1)(b)(ii).

#### Subdivision 832-J—Integrity rule

##### 832-720 What this Subdivision is about

This Subdivision contains an integrity measure that disallows an
Australian deduction for a payment of interest (or a payment of a
similar character) made by an entity (the paying entity) under a
scheme to a foreign entity (the interposed foreign entity). The
deduction will be disallowed if certain conditions are satisfied,
including that:

(a) the paying entity, the interposed foreign entity and
another foreign entity (the ultimate parent entity) are in
the same Division 832 control group; and

(b) the payment is not subject to Australian income tax; and

(c) the highest rate of foreign income tax (the foreign
**_country rate) on the payment is 10% or less; and_**

(d) it is reasonable to conclude (having regard to certain
matters) that the entity, or one of the entities, that
entered into or carried out all or part of the scheme did
so for a purpose including a purpose of enabling a

enabling foreign income tax to be imposed on the

However, the deduction will not be disallowed if, assuming that the
payment had been made directly to the ultimate parent entity:

(a) the rate of foreign income tax on the payment in the

_Separation of currency effects for Division 230 gains and losses_

(2) For the purposes of this Division, split a gain into 2 separate gains,

(5) If there is an amount treated under paragraph (2)(b) or (3)(b) as a
separate gain from a *financial arrangement, the gain is treated as
consisting of any actual payments made under the financial
arrangement and taken into account in working out the amount of
the gain or loss the entity made under the arrangement.

(6) For the purposes of this Division, assume the gain is an amount
that, subject to Division 6 (about effect of foreign residence), is
included in the entity’s assessable income.

##### Section 840-805

Note 1: The tax, which is called managed investment trust withholding tax, is
imposed by the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding
_Tax) Act 2008 and the rate of the tax is set out in that Act._

Note 2: See Subdivision 12-H in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration
_Act 1953 for provisions dealing with withholding from fund payments,_
and Subdivision 12A-C in that Schedule for provisions dealing with
obligations to pay the Commissioner amounts analogous to such
withholding in relation to AMITs.

Note 3: This subsection does not apply to residents of information exchange
countries for the first income year starting on or after the first 1 July
after the day on which the Tax Laws Amendment (Election
_Commitments No. 1) Act 2008 receives the Royal Assent._
Subdivision 840-M of the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act
_1997 applies instead._

_Payments from withholding MITs_

(2) This subsection applies to you if:

(a) you are paid an amount from a trust that is a *withholding
MIT in relation to an income year, or an amount is applied or
dealt with as you direct by such a trust; and

(b) all or part of that amount (the fund payment part) is
represented by a *fund payment in relation to that year; and

(c) you are, in respect of the fund payment part, a beneficiary
(but not a beneficiary in the capacity of a trustee of another
trust); and

(d) you are a foreign resident when you are paid the amount or
when the amount is applied or dealt with as you direct.

Note 1: Because a fund payment can be adjusted to account for earlier fund
payments and the expected amounts of later fund payments (see
subsection 12A-110(5) in Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration
_Act 1953), the amount of a particular fund payment may not reflect the_
actual amount you are paid for the purposes of this subsection.

Note 2: If the withholding MIT is an AMIT, under subsection 12A-205(2) in
Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953, amounts may be
treated, for the purposes of this Subdivision, as having been paid to
you from the trustee of the AMIT.

reasonably attributable to a *fund payment in relation to an

to that year; and

(but not a beneficiary in the capacity of a trustee of another
trust); and

(d) you are a foreign resident when you are paid the amount or
when the amount is applied or dealt with as you direct; and

(e) either:

(i) the custodian is not a company; or

(ii) if it is a company, it would be acting in the capacity as
your *agent apart from section 840-820.

Note: If the withholding MIT is an AMIT, under subsection 12A-205(5) in
Schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953, amounts may be
treated, for the purposes of this Subdivision, as having been paid to
you from the custodian.

_Entitlements to amounts from other entities_

(4) This subsection applies to you if:

(a) you are a beneficiary of a trust (that is not a *withholding
MIT or a *custodian) and are presently entitled to a share of
the income or capital of the trust; and

(b) all or part of that share (also the fund payment part) is
reasonably attributable to a payment that is a *fund payment
in relation to an income year made by a trust that is a
withholding MIT in relation to that year; and

(c) you are not, in respect of that share, a beneficiary in the
capacity of a trustee of another trust; and

(d) you are a foreign resident at the time (the entitlement time)
when you became presently entitled.

total participation interests in the entity is 50% or more

being wound down.

##### 842-235 Rules for determining total participation interests for the purposes of the widely held test

(1) For the purposes of subsection 842-230(2), apply the rules in this
section in determining an entity’s *total participation interest in
another entity (the test entity).

(2) If an entity has, through one or more interposed entities, an

##### Section 842-235

(b) instead, treat the other entity as having those interests and
rights (in addition to the other entity’s interests and rights
apart from this subsection).

(6) If an entity that has a *direct participation interest or *indirect
participation interest in the test entity is an entity covered by:

(a) paragraph 842-230(1)(a), (b) or (c); or

(b) paragraph 275-20(4)(f) (foreign collective investment
vehicles with a wide membership);

treat the entity’s *total participation interest in the test entity as nil.

(7) The application of subsection (6) to an entity that has a *direct
participation interest or *indirect participation interest in the test
entity does not affect the *total participation interest in the test
entity of any other entity that has a direct participation interest or
indirect participation interest in the test entity.

(8) In determining a *direct participation interest of one entity in
another entity, disregard paragraph 350(1)(b) of the Income Tax
_Assessment Act 1936 (rights of shareholders to vote or participate_
in certain decision-making).

(9) If the test entity is an *IMR entity and another entity is an
independent fund manager for the test entity, in determining the
*total participation interest of the other entity, or any entity
*connected with the other entity, in the test entity, disregard any
direct or indirect entitlements (including contingent entitlements)
of the other entity, or connected entity, to remuneration from the
test entity:

(a) to the extent that the remuneration is subject to income tax in
relation to the income year for which the consequences (if
any) under subsection 842-215(1) or (2) are being determined
in relation to the test entity; and

(b) to the extent that the remuneration is subject to taxation in
relation to that income year under a *foreign law.

Example: Assume that 4 entities have interests in an IMR entity, as follows:
(a) a life insurance company has a 55% interest;

(b) an endowment fund has a 5% interest;

##### Section 842-240

(c) company A has a 25% interest. It has 2 shareholders (who are not
affiliated): shareholder Y holds 60% of the shares and
shareholder Z holds 40%;

(d) company B has a 15% interest. It has several shareholders.

The IMR entity is an IMR widely held entity because:
(e) under subsection 842-235(6), the life insurance company has a
total participation interest of nil, as it is covered by
paragraph 275-20(4)(a); and

(f) the endowment fund has a total participation interest below the
20% threshold in subparagraph 842-230(2)(a)(i); and

(g) under subsection 842-235(2), company A’s 25% interest is
divided between shareholder Y (15%) and shareholder Z (10%),
and company A is treated as having a total participation interest
in the IMR entity of nil; and

(h) company B’s 15% interest is below the 20% threshold, so none
of its shareholders can have a total participation interest above
that threshold. (In these circumstances, it is not necessary to
determine the total participation interests for each of those
shareholders.)

(Treating the life insurance company’s 55% interest as a total
participation interest of nil ensures that no summing of the other total
participation interest can exceed the 50% threshold in
subparagraph 842-230(2)(a)(ii).)

##### 842-240 Extended meaning of IMR widely held entity —temporary circumstances outside entity’s control

Without limiting section 842-230, an entity is an IMR **_widely held_**
**_entity if:_**

(a) apart from a particular circumstance, the entity would be an
*IMR widely held entity because of section 842-230; and

(b) the circumstance is temporary; and

(c) the circumstance arose outside the entity’s control; and

(d) it is fair and reasonable to treat the entity as an IMR widely
held entity, having regard to the following matters:

(i) the matters in paragraphs (b) and (c);

(ii) the nature of the circumstance;

(iii) the actions (if any) taken by the entity to address or
remove the circumstance, and the speed with which
such actions are taken;

A foreign resident can disregard a capital gain or loss unless the
relevant CGT asset is a direct or indirect interest in Australian real
property, or relates to a business carried on by the foreign resident
through a permanent establishment in Australia.

Special rules apply for individuals who were Australian residents
but have become foreign residents (see also Subdivision 104-I) and
for foreign resident beneficiaries of fixed trusts.

There are also rules dealing with what happens when a foreign
resident becomes an Australian resident.

##### 855-5 Objects of this Subdivision

(1) The objects of this Subdivision are to improve:

(a) Australia’s status as an attractive place for business and
investment; and

(b) the integrity of Australia’s capital gains tax base.

(2) This is achieved by:

(a) aligning Australia’s tax laws with international practice; and

(b) ensuring interests in an entity remain subject to Australia’s
capital gains tax laws if the entity’s underlying value is
principally derived from Australian real property.

##### 855-10 Disregarding a capital gain or loss from CGT events

(1) Disregard a *capital gain or *capital loss from a *CGT event if:

(a) you are a foreign resident, or the trustee of a *foreign trust for
CGT purposes, just before the CGT event happens; and

(b) the CGT event happens in relation to a *CGT asset that is not
*taxable Australian property.

Note: A capital gain or capital loss from a CGT asset you have used at any
time in carrying on a business through a permanent establishment in
Australia may be reduced under section 855-35.

(2) The *CGT asset in relation to which a *CGT event happens
includes the following:

(a) for CGT event D1 (about creating contractual or other
rights)—the CGT asset that is the subject of the creation of
the contractual or other rights;

Example:You grant an easement over land in Australia. The land is the
subject of the creation of the rights in the easement. Therefore,
the CGT event happens in relation to the land.

Note 2: The market value of an asset of the other entity that is not taxable
Australian real property, and is duplicated within the other entity’s
corporate group, could be disregarded (see section 855-32).

(4A) For the purposes of working out the *total participation interests
held by the holding entity and its *associates under item 1 of the
table in subsection (4), take into account:

##### 855-32 Disregard market value of duplicated non-TARP assets

(1) The purpose of this section is to prevent double counting of the
*market value of the assets of a corporate group that:

(a) are not *taxable Australian real property; and

(b) are created under *arrangements under which corresponding
liabilities are created in other members of the group.

(2) For the purposes of subsections 855-30(2) and (4), subsection (4)
of this section applies to an asset that is not *taxable Australian real
property if:

(a) the parties to an *arrangement included the 2 entities referred
to in subsection (3); and

(b) an effect of the arrangement was to create, before the *CGT
event happened:

(i) the asset as an asset of one of those 2 parties; and

(ii) a corresponding liability of the other (the other party).

event trust at the time of the CGT event; or

(ii) the asset is an interest in a fixed trust and the conditions
in subsections (5), (6), (7) and (8) are satisfied.

capital gain made by a beneficiary, and applies the CGT discount
to that portion as if the gain were made directly by the
beneficiary.

(3) You are not liable to pay tax as a trustee of a *fixed trust in respect
of an amount to the extent that the amount gives rise to a *capital
gain that is disregarded for a beneficiary under subsection (2).

(4) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) does not affect the operation of
subsection 98A(1) or (3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
(about taxing beneficiaries who are foreign residents at the end of
an income year).
