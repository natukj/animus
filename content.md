70-5 The 3 key features of tax accounting for trading stock

##### 70-5  The 3 key features of tax accounting for trading stock

The purpose of income tax accounting for trading stock is to
produce an overall result that (apart from concessions) properly
reflects your activities with your trading stock during the income
year.

There are 3 key features:

(1) You bring your gross outgoings and earnings to account, not
your net profits and losses on disposal of trading stock.

(2) Those outgoings and earnings are on revenue account, not
capital account. As a result:

(a) the gross outgoings are usually deductible as general
deductions under section 8-1 (when the trading stock
becomes trading stock on hand); and

(b) the gross earnings are usually assessable as ordinary
income under section 6-5 (when the trading stock stops
being trading stock on hand).

(3) You must bring to account any difference between the value
of your trading stock on hand at the start and at the end of the
income year. This is done in such a way that, in effect:

(a) you account for the value of your trading stock as
assessable income; and

(b) you carry that value over as a corresponding deduction
for the next income year.

Note: You may not have to bring to account that difference if you are a
small business entity: see Division 328.

##### Section 70-20

connection with acquiring an item of * trading stock. (The outgoing
must be deductible under that section.)

(2) If the item becomes part of your * trading stock on hand before or
during the income year in which you incur the outgoing, deduct it
in that income year.

(3) Otherwise, deduct the outgoing in the first income year:

(a) during which the item becomes part of your * trading stock on
hand; or

(b) for which an amount is included in your assessable income in
connection with the disposal of that item.

Note You can deduct your capital costs of acquiring land carrying trees or
of acquiring a right to fell trees, to the extent that the trees are felled
for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you. (This is because the trees
will then usually become your trading stock.) See section 70-120.

##### 70-20  Non-arm’s length transactions

If:

(a) you incur an outgoing that is directly attributable to your
buying or obtaining delivery of an item of your * trading
stock; and

(b) you and the seller of the item did not deal with each other at
* arm’s length; and

(c) the amount of the outgoing is greater than the * market value
of what the outgoing is for;

the amount of the outgoing is instead taken to be that market value.
This has effect for the purposes of applying this Act to you and
also to the seller.

Note: This section also affects the value of the item of trading stock at the
end of an income year if you value it at its cost under section 70-45
(Value of trading stock at end of income year).

##### 70-25  Cost of trading stock is not a capital outgoing

An outgoing you incur in connection with acquiring an item of
* trading stock is not an outgoing of capital or of a capital nature.

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Trading stock **Part 2-25**

Trading stock **Division 70**

##### Section 70-30

Note: This means that paragraph 8-1(2)(a) does not prevent the outgoing
from being a general deduction under section 8-1.

##### 70-30  Starting to hold as trading stock an item you already own

(1) If you start holding as * trading stock an item you already own, but
do not hold as trading stock, you are treated as if:.

(a) just before it became trading stock, you had sold the item to
someone else (at * arm’s length) for whichever of these
amounts you elect:

- its cost (as worked out under subsection (3) or (4));

- its * market value just before it became trading stock; and

(b) you had immediately bought it back for the same amount.

Example: You start holding a depreciating asset as part of your trading stock.
You are treated as having sold it just before that time, and
immediately bought it back, for its cost or market value, whichever
you elect. (Subdivision 40-D provides for the consequences of selling
depreciating assets.)

The same amount is normally a general deduction under section 8-1 as
an outgoing in connection with acquiring trading stock. The amount is
also taken into account in working out the item’s cost for the purposes
of section 70-45 (about valuing trading stock at the end of the income
year).

Note: Depending on how you elect under paragraph (1)(a), the sale may or
may not give rise to a capital gain or a capital loss for the purposes of
Parts 3-1 and 3-3 (about CGT). It does not if you elect to be treated as
having sold the item for what would have been its cost: see
subsection 118-25(2). However, it can if you elect market value.

_When you must make the election_

(2) You must make the election by the time you lodge your * income
tax return for the income year in which you start holding the item
as * trading stock. (If you do not make the election by then because
you do not realise until later that you started to hold the item as
trading stock, you must make the election as soon as is reasonable
after realising that.)

##### Section 70-30

However, the Commissioner can allow you to make it later (in
either case).

_How to work out the item’s cost_

(3) The item’s cost is what would have been its cost for the purposes
of section 70-45 (about valuing trading stock at the end of the
income year) if it had been your * trading stock ever since you last
acquired it. In working that out, disregard section 70-55 (about
acquiring live stock by natural increase).

(4) However, if you last acquired the item for no consideration, its cost
is worked out using this table:

**Cost of item acquired for no consideration**

**Item** **In this case:** **The cost is:**

the item’s * market value when you
last acquired it

1 you acquired the item during or
after the 1998-99 income year, and
the acquisition involved a * CGT
event

the item’s * market value when you
last acquired it

2 you acquired the item before or
during the 1997-98 income year,
and the acquisition involved a
disposal of the item to you within
the meaning of former Part IIIA
(Capital gains and capital losses) of
the _Income Tax Assessment Act_
_1936_

##### Section 70-30

**Cost of item acquired for no consideration**

**Item** **In this case:** **The cost is:**

(a) if the person died during or after
his or her 1998-99 income year—
the dead person’s * cost base for
the item just before his or her
death; or

3 your acquisition of the item
involved the item:
(a) devolving to you as someone’s
* legal personal representative;
or

(b)  * passing to you as a beneficiary
in someone’s estate;

and, if a * CGT event had happened
in relation to the item just before
you started holding it as * trading
stock, a * capital gain or * capital
loss could have resulted that would
have been taken into account in
working out your * net capital gain
or * net capital loss for the income
year of the event

(b) if the person died before or during
his or her 1997-98 income year—
the dead person’s indexed cost
base (within the meaning of
former Part IIIA (Capital gains
and capital losses) of the _Income_
_Tax Assessment Act 1936_ ) for the
item just before his or her death
(but worked out disregarding
former section 160ZG (which
affects the indexed cost base for a
non-listed personal use asset) of
that Act)

a nil amount

4 any other case where you last
acquired the item for no
consideration

_Exceptions_

(5) Subsection (1) does not apply if you start holding any of the
following as * trading stock because they are severed from land:

(a) standing or growing crops;

(b) crop-stools;

(c) trees planted and tended for sale.

(This does not prevent subsection (1) from applying to a severed
item that you later start holding as trading stock.)

(6) Subsection (1) does not apply if:

(a) you start holding an item as * trading stock; and

(b) immediately before you started holding the item as trading
stock, you * held the item as a * registered emissions unit.

stock in the ordinary course of business if the body ceases to exist and
disposes of the asset to a company that has not significantly different
ownership: see Division 620.

(2) If an item stops being your trading stock for certain other reasons,
an amount is generally included in your assessable income to
balance the reduction in trading stock on hand, which is a
transaction on revenue account.

(3) The other reasons for an item to stop being your trading stock are:

(a) you dispose of it outside the ordinary course of business; or

(b) interests in it change; or

(c) you die; or

(d) you stop holding it as trading stock.

#### Operative provisions

(1A) If the disposal is the giving of a gift of property by you for which a
valuation under section 30-212 is obtained, you may choose that
the * market value is replaced with the value of the property as
determined under the valuation. You can only make this choice if
the valuation was made no more than 90 days before or after the
disposal.

(2) Any amount that you actually receive for the disposal is not
included in your assessable income (nor is it * exempt income).

Note 1: In the case of an asset covered by section 70-85 (which applies this
Subdivision to certain other assets), the disposal will usually involve
disposing of the land of which the asset forms part.

Note 2: For certain disposals of live stock by primary producers, special rules
apply: see Subdivision 385-E.

Note 3: If the disposal is by way of gift, you may be able to deduct the gift:
see Division 30 (Gifts).

Note 4: If the disposal is of trees, you can deduct the relevant portion of your
capital costs of acquiring the land carrying the trees or of acquiring a
right to fell the trees: see section 70-120.

Note 5: This section and section 70-95 also apply to disposals of certain items
on hand at the end of 1996-97 that are not trading stock but were

##### Section 70-95

trading stock as defined in the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ : see
section 70-10 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ .

##### 70-95  Purchase price is taken to be market value

If an entity disposes of an item of the entity’s * trading stock
outside the ordinary course of * business, the entity acquiring the
item is treated as having bought it for the amount included in the
disposing entity’s assessable income under section 70-90.

##### 70-100  Notional disposal when you stop holding an item as trading
##### stock

(1) An item of * trading stock is treated as having been disposed of
outside the ordinary course of * business if it stops being trading
stock on hand of an entity (the **_transferor_** ) **__** and, immediately
afterwards:

(a) the transferor is not the item’s sole owner; but

(b) an entity that owned the item (alone or with others)
immediately beforehand still has an interest in the item.

Example: A grocer decides to take her daughters into partnership with her. Her
trading stock becomes part of the partnership assets, owned by the
partners equally. As a result, it becomes trading stock on hand of the
partnership instead of the grocer. This section treats the grocer as
having disposed of the trading stock to the partnership outside the
ordinary course of her business.

Note: If the transferor _is_ the item’s sole owner after it stops being trading
stock on hand of the transferor, section 70-110 applies instead of this
section.

(2) As a result, the transferor’s assessable income includes the * market
value of the item on the day it stops being * trading stock on hand
of the transferor.

(3) The entity or entities (the **_transferee_** ) that own the item
immediately _after_ it stops being * trading stock on hand of the
transferor are **__** treated as having bought the item for the same value
on that day.

Trading stock **Division 70**

##### Section 70-100

_Election to treat item as disposed of at closing value_

(4) However, an election can be made to treat the item as having been
disposed of for what would have been its * value as * trading stock
of the _transferor_ on hand at the end of an income year ending on
that day.

(5) If this election is made, this * value is included in the transferor’s
assessable income for the income year that includes that day. The
transferee is treated as having bought the item for the same value
on that day.

(6) This election can only be made if:

(a) immediately _after_ the item stops being * trading stock on hand
of the transferor, it is an asset of a * business carried on by the
transferee; and

(b) immediately _after_ the item stops being trading stock on hand
of the transferor, the entities that owned it immediately
beforehand have (between them) interests in the item whose
total value is at least 25% of the item’s * market value on that
day; and

(c) the * value elected is _less than_ that market value; and

(d) the item is not a thing in action.

(7) Also, the election can only be made before 1 September following
the end of the * financial year in which the item stops being * trading
stock on hand of the transferor. However, the Commissioner can
allow the election to be made later.

(8) An election must be in writing and signed by or on behalf of each
of:

(a) the entities that own the item immediately before it stops
being * trading stock on hand of the transferor; and

(b) the entities that own it immediately afterwards.

(9) If a person whose signature is required for the election has died,
the * legal personal representative of that person’s estate may sign
instead.

##### Section 70-105

_When election has no effect_

(10) An election has no effect if:

(a) the item stops being * trading stock on hand of the transferor
outside the course of ordinary family or commercial dealing;
and

(b) the * consideration receivable by the transferor (or by any of
the entities constituting the transferor) substantially exceeds
what would reasonably be expected to be the consideration
receivable by the entity concerned if the * market value of the
item immediately before it stops being trading stock on hand
of the transferor were the * value elected under subsection (4).

Note: Section 960-255 may be relevant to determining family relationships
for the purposes of paragraph (10)(a).

(11) **_Consideration receivable_** by an entity means so much of the value
of any benefit as it is reasonable to expect that the entity will
obtain in connection with the item ceasing to be * trading stock on
hand of the transferor.

##### 70-105  Death of owner

(1) When you die, your assessable income up to the time of your death
includes the * market value at that time of the * trading stock of your
* business (if any).

Note: In the case of trees, you can deduct the relevant portion of your capital
costs of acquiring the land carrying the trees or of acquiring a right to
fell the trees: see section 70-120.

(2) The entity on which the * trading stock devolves is treated as having
bought it for its * market value at that time.

(3) However, your * legal personal representative can elect to have
included in your assessable income (instead of the * market value)
the amount that would have been the * value of the * trading stock at
the end of an income year ending on the day of your death.

(4) In the case of an asset covered by section 70-85 (which applies this
Subdivision to certain other assets), your * legal personal

representative can elect to have a nil amount included in your
assessable income (instead of the * market value).

(5) Your * legal personal representative can make an election only if:

(a) the * business is carried on after your death; and

(b) the * trading stock continues to be held as trading stock of that
business, or the asset continues to be held as an asset of that
business, as appropriate.

(6) If an election is made, the entity on which the * trading stock
devolves is treated as having bought it for the amount referred to in
subsection (3) or (4).

(7) An election can only be made on or before the day when your
* legal personal representative lodges your * income tax return for
the period up to your death. However, the Commissioner can allow
it to be made later.

##### 70-110  You stop holding an item as trading stock but still own it

(1) If you stop holding an item as * trading stock, but still own it, you
are treated as if:

(a) just before it stopped being trading stock, you had sold it to
someone else (at * arm’s length and in the ordinary course of
business) for its * cost; and

(b) you had immediately bought it back for the same amount.

Example 1:You are a sheep grazier and take a sheep from your stock to slaughter
for personal consumption. You are treated as having sold it for its
cost. This amount is assessable income, just like the proceeds of sale
of any of your trading stock.

Although you are also treated as having bought the sheep for the same
amount, it would not be deductible because the sheep is for personal
consumption.

Example 2:You stop holding an item as trading stock and begin to use it as a
depreciating asset for the purpose of producing your assessable
income. You are treated as having sold it for its cost. This amount is
assessable income, just like the proceeds of sale of any of your trading
stock.

purposes (see Subdivision 40-C) and the item’s cost base for CGT
purposes (see Division 110).

(2) This section does not apply if:

(a) you stop holding an item as * trading stock; and

(b) immediately after you stopped holding the item as trading
stock, you start to * hold the item as a * registered emissions
unit.

Note: A transaction that this section treats as having occurred is disregarded
for the purposes of these provisions of the _Income Tax Assessment Act_
_1936_ :
- subsection 47A(10) (which treats certain benefits as dividends
paid by a CFC)

- paragraph 103A(3A)(c) (which affects whether a company is a
public company for an income year).

##### 70-115  Compensation for lost trading stock

Your assessable income includes an amount that:

(a) you receive by way of insurance or indemnity for a loss of
* trading stock; and

(b) is not assessable as * ordinary income under section 6-5.

##### 70-120  Deducting capital costs of acquiring trees

(1) This section gives you deductions for your capital costs of
acquiring land carrying trees or of acquiring a right to fell trees.

Note: This section is included in this Division because:
- trees felled for sale, or for use in manufacture, by you will
usually become your trading stock; and

- before they are felled, the trees are covered by sections 70-90 and
70-105 because of section 70-85.

death).

(It does not matter when you acquired the land.)

Note: The market value of trees is _not_ included in your assessable income

payments
**Division 82** Employment termination payments

##### Section 82-60

termination payment you have received earlier in
consequence of the same employment termination (whether
in the income year or an earlier income year).

#### Subdivision 82-B—Employment termination payments: death
#### benefits

#### Guide to Subdivision 82-B

##### 82-60  What this Subdivision is about

If you receive a death benefit termination payment after the death
of a person, part of the payment may be tax free (the tax free
component).

You are entitled to a tax offset on the remaining part of the
payment (the taxable component), subject to limitations.

The extent of your entitlement to the offset depends on whether or
not you were a death benefits dependant of the deceased, and on
the total amount of payments you receive in consequence of the
same employment termination.

If a death benefit termination payment is payable to the trustee of
the estate of the deceased for the benefit of another person, the
payment is taxed in the hands of the trustee in the same way as it
would be taxed if it had been paid directly to the other person.

leave that you used in the period.

_Exception if days used exceed days accrued in the pre-18/8/93_
_period and the post-17/8/93 period_

(2) To the extent that the number of days of long service leave that you
used during the * pre-18/8/93 period or the * post-17/8/93 period
exceeds the number of days of long service leave that accrued to
you during the period, apply the excess days as shown in this table:

**How to apply excess days**

**Apply the excess**
**days as follows:**

**Item** **If there are**
**excess days in**
**this period:**

**If, after you apply the excess**
**days as shown in column 2,**
**excess days remain, apply the**
**remaining days as follows:**

1 * pre-18/8/93
period

Subtract the excess days from the
unused days in the * pre-16/8/78
period

Subtract the excess
days from the
unused days in the
* post-17/8/93 period

2 * post-17/8/93
period

Subtract the excess days from the
unused days in the * pre-16/8/78
period

Subtract the excess
days from the
unused days in the
* pre-18/8/93 period

(3) The number of **_unused days of long service leave_** in each period is
the number of days after applying the table.

##### early retirement scheme payments

(1) This section applies if you receive a * genuine redundancy payment
or an * early retirement scheme payment.

conditions:

(a) the employee is dismissed before the earlier of the following:

If there is a real risk you might forfeit the share, right or stapled
security you acquired under an employee share scheme, you don’t
include the discount in your assessable income when you acquired
it. Instead, in the first income year you are able to dispose of the

gain you have made to that time. If 15 years pass, the gain is
included in that income year instead.

This deferred taxing point can also apply to:

(a) a share or stapled security you acquire under salary
sacrifice arrangements, if you get no more than $5,000
worth of shares under those arrangements; or

(b) a right, if the scheme restricted you immediately
disposing of the right, and stated that this Subdivision
applies.

(b) at the time you acquired the interest:

(i) the scheme genuinely restricted you immediately

a different amount for the market value of the ESS interest.

(2) Treat an amount included in your assessable income under
subsection (1) as being from a source other than an * Australian

connection with the takeover or restructure as a continuation of the
old interests, to the extent that:

(a) as a result of the arrangement or change, you stop holding the
old interests; and

(b) the new interests can reasonably be regarded as matching any
of the old interests.

Note: In determining to what extent something can reasonably be regarded
as matching any of the old interests, one of the factors to consider is
the respective market values of that thing and of the old interests.

(3) Subsection 83A-45(4) (about the minimum holding period) is taken
to apply to the * ESS interests.

(4) Subsections (2) and (3) only apply if the new interests relate to

reduction.

You must defer any deduction you are entitled to for amounts you
provide to finance your employees acquiring interests in shares,
rights or stapled securities under an employee share scheme until
the employees have actually acquired those interests.

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-40** Rules affecting employees and other taxpayers receiving PAYG withholding
payments
**Division 83A** Employee share schemes

##### Section 83A-310

(a) treat the interest as having being acquired by the individual
(instead of the associate); and

(b) treat any circumstance, right or obligation existing or not
existing in relation to the interest in relation to the associate
as existing or not existing in relation to the individual; and

(c) treat anything done or not done by or in relation to the
associate in relation to the interest as being done or not done
by or in relation to the individual.

Example 1:The following are attributed to the employee, rather than to the
associate:
(a) the associate’s voting rights;

(b) the associate’s ability or inability to dispose of the ESS interest;

(c) whether there is a real risk that the associate may lose the ESS
interest;

(d) the associate’s cost base for the ESS interest.

Example 2:If the associate disposes of the ESS interest, the employee is taken to
have disposed of the ESS interest instead.

(2) For the purposes of subsections 83A-45(6) and (7), subsection (1)
of this section also applies if the * associate acquired the * ESS
interest otherwise than in relation to the individual’s employment.

##### 83A-310  Forfeiture etc. of ESS interest

(1) This Division (apart from this Subdivision) is taken never to have
applied in relation to an * ESS interest acquired by an individual
under an * employee share scheme if:

(a) disregarding this section, an amount is included in the
individual’s assessable income under this Division in relation
to the interest; and

(b) either:

(i) the individual forfeits the interest; or

(ii) in the case of an ESS interest that is a beneficial interest
in a right—the individual forfeits or loses the interest
(without having disposed of the interest or exercised the
right); and

(c) the forfeiture or loss is not the result of:

##### Section 83A-315

(i) a choice made by the individual (other than a choice to
which subsection (2) applies); or

(ii) a condition of the scheme that has the direct effect of
protecting (wholly or partly) the individual against a fall
in the * market value of the interest.

(2) This subsection applies to the following choices by the individual:

(a) a choice to cease particular employment;

(b) in the case of an * ESS interest that is a beneficial interest in a
right:

(i) a choice not to exercise the right before it lapsed; or

(ii) a choice to allow the right to be cancelled.

##### 83A-315  Market value of ESS interest

(1) Whenever this Division (other than section 83A-20) uses the
* market value of an * ESS interest, instead use the amount specified
in the regulations for the purposes of this section in relation to the
interest, if the regulations specify such an amount.

(2) To avoid doubt, apply the rule in subsection (1) to the * market
value component of any calculation for the purposes of this
Division that involves market value.

Example: If the regulations specify an amount in relation to an ESS interest, use
that amount instead of the market value of the interest in working out:
(a) whether there is a discount given in relation to interest; and

(b) if so—the amount of the discount.

##### 83A-320  Interests in a trust

(1) This section applies if, at a time:

(a) you hold an interest in a trust whose assets include * shares;
and

(b) that interest corresponds to a particular number of the shares
(even if the interest does not correspond to particular shares).

form the stapled security is an ordinary share in the company.

(3) For the purposes of this Division, in relation to a stapled security or

(b) the right later becomes a right to acquire a beneficial interest
in a * share.

(a) shares with a specified total value, rather than a specified number
of shares; or

(b) an indeterminate number of shares.

Example 2:You acquire a right under which the provider must provide you with
either ESS interests or cash, whichever the provider chooses.

(2) This Division applies as if the right had always been a right to
acquire the beneficial interest in the * share.

## Part 2-42—Personal services income

### Division 84—Introduction


#### Guide to Part 2-42

##### 84-1  What this Part is about

This Part is about 2 issues relating to personal services income.

Division 85 limits the entitlements of individuals to deductions
relating to their personal services income.

Division 86 sets out the tax consequences of individuals’ personal
services income being diverted to other entities (often called
alienation of the income).

These Divisions do not affect individuals or other entities that
conduct personal services businesses. Division 87 defines personal
services businesses.

Note: This Part may not apply until the 2002-03 income year to participants
in the prescribed payments system on 13 April 2000: see item 26 of
Schedule 1 to the _New Business Tax System (Alienation of Personal_
_Services Income) Act 2000_ .

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-42** Personal services income
**Division 84** Introduction

##### Section 84-5

#### Operative provisions

##### 84-5  Meaning of **_personal services income_**

(1) Your * ordinary income or * statutory income, or the ordinary
income or statutory income of any other entity, is your **_personal_**
**_services income_** if the income is mainly a reward for your personal
efforts or skills (or would mainly be such a reward if it was your
income).

Example 1:NewIT Pty. Ltd. provides computer programming services, but Ron
does all the work involved in providing those services. Ron uses the
clients’ equipment and software to do the work. NewIT’s ordinary
income from providing the services is Ron’s personal services income
because it is a reward for his personal efforts or skills.

Example 2:Trux Pty. Ltd. owns one semi-trailer, and Tom is the only person who
drives it. Trux’s ordinary income from transporting goods is not
Tom’s personal services income because it is produced mainly by use
of the semi-trailer, and not mainly as a reward for Tom’s personal
efforts or skills.

Example 3:Jim works as an accountant for a large accounting firm that employs
many accountants. None of the firm’s ordinary income or statutory
income is Jim’s personal services income because it is produced
mainly by the firm’s business structure, and not mainly as a reward for
Jim’s personal efforts or skills.

(2) Only individuals can have personal services income.

(3) This section applies whether the income is for doing work or is for
producing a result.

(4) The fact that the income is payable under a contract does not stop
the income being mainly a reward for your personal efforts or
skills.

##### 84-10  This Part does not imply that individuals are employees

The application of this Part to an individual does not imply, for the
purposes of any * Australian law or any instrument made under an
Australian law, that the individual is an employee.

**Part 2-42** Personal services income
**Division 85** Deductions relating to personal services income

##### Section 85-10

(b) you would not be able to deduct the amount under this Act if
the income were payable to you as an employee.

Example: Ruth is an architect who works as an independent contractor for one
firm. She is not conducting a personal services business. On most days
she travels from her home to the business premises of the firm, where
she does her work. She also has a home office, where she does some
of her work.

This section confirms that Ruth cannot deduct her expenses of
travelling between her home and the firm’s premises because she
could not deduct them if she were an employee.

(2) Subsection (1) does not stop you deducting an amount to the extent
that it relates to:

(a) gaining work; or

Examples: Advertising, tendering and quoting for work.

(b) insuring against loss of your income or your income earning
capacity; or

Examples: Sickness, accident and disability insurance.

(c) insuring against liability arising from your acts or omissions
in the course of earning income; or

insurance.

(d) engaging an entity that is not your * associate to perform
work; or

ordinary income of NewIT from providing the computer programming
services, because the income is Ron’s personal services income.

Note: The amount included in your assessable income can be reduced by
certain deductions to which the personal services entity is entitled: see
section 86-20.

(2) A **_personal services entity_** is a company, partnership or trust whose
* ordinary income or * statutory income includes the * personal
services income of one or more individuals.

_Exception: personal services businesses_

(3) This section does not apply if that amount is income from the
* personal services entity conducting a * personal services business.

Note: Even if the entity is conducting a personal services business, it is
possible that some of its income is not income from conducting that
business.

_Exception: amounts promptly paid to you as salary or wages_

(4) This section does not apply to the extent that:

(a) the * personal services entity pays that amount to you, as an
employee, as salary or wages; and

(b) the payment is made before the end of the 14th day after the
* PAYG payment period during which the amount became
* ordinary income or * statutory income of the entity.

Note: The entity is obliged to withhold amounts from salary or wages paid
before the end of that day: see section 12-35 in Schedule 1 to the
_Taxation Administration Act 1953_ .

_Exception: exempt income etc._

(5) This section only applies to the extent that that amount would be
assessable income of the personal services entity if this Division
did not apply.

Example: If the entity’s income includes an amount that is your personal
services income for a service on which GST is payable, the amount
included in your assessable income will not include the GST, because
the GST is neither assessable income nor exempt income of the entity:
see section 17-5.

**Part 2-42** Personal services income
**Division 86** Alienation of personal services income

##### Section 86-20

##### 86-20  Offsetting the personal services entity’s deductions against
##### personal services income

(1) The amount of your * personal services income included in your
assessable income under section 86-15 may be reduced (but not
below nil) by the amount of certain deductions to which the
* personal services entity is entitled.

Note 1: Subdivision 86-B limits a personal services entity’s entitlement to
deductions.

Note 2: If the amount of the deductions exceeds the amount of the personal
services income, a deduction for the excess is available to you under
section 86-27. The personal services entity cannot deduct the amount
of the excess: see section 86-87.

(2) Use this method statement to work out whether, and by how much,
the amount is reduced:

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out, for the income year, the amount of any
deductions (other than * entity maintenance deductions or
deductions for amounts of salary or wages paid to you ) to
which the * personal services entity is entitled that are
deductions relating to your * personal services income.

Step 2. Work out, for the income year, the amount of any * entity
maintenance deductions to which the * personal services
entity is entitled.

Step 3. Work out the * personal services entity’s assessable
income for that income year, disregarding any income it
receives that is your * personal services income or the
personal services income of anyone else.

Personal services income **Part 2-42**

Alienation of personal services income **Division 86**

##### Section 86-20

Step 4. Subtract the amount under step 3 from the amount under
step 2.

Note 1: Step 4 ensures that, before entity maintenance
deductions can contribute to the reduction, they are first
exhausted against any income of the entity that is not
personal services income.

Note 2: If the personal services entity receives another
individual’s personal services income, see section 86-25.

Step 5. If the amount under step 4 is greater than zero, the
amount of the reduction under subsection (1) is the sum
of the amounts under steps 1 and 4.

Step 6 _._ If the amount under step 4 is not greater than zero, the
amount of the reduction under subsection (1) is the
amount under step 1.

Example 1:Continuing example 1 in section 84-5: Assume these additional facts:

- $120,000 of NewIT’s income is Ron’s personal services income;

- NewIT has deductions (including superannuation contributions)
of $50,000 relating to Ron’s personal services income (step 1);

- NewIT has entity maintenance deductions of $8,000 (step 2);

- NewIT has investments that produce income. NewIT’s assessable
income, disregarding Ron’s or anyone else’s personal services
income, is $20,000 (step 3).

Because the step 4 amount is less than zero (-$12,000), step 5 does not
apply and, under step 6, the amount of the reduction is $50,000.
Therefore the amount included in Ron’s assessable income is:

$120,000 – $50,000 $70,000 

Example 2:Assume, as an alternative set of facts, that NewIT’s assessable income
under step 3 was only $2,000.

The step 4 amount would have been $6,000, and, under step 5, the
amount of the reduction would have been $56,000 (adding the
amounts under steps 1 and 4). The amount included in Ron’s
assessable income would then have been:

$120,000 – $56,000 $64,000 

Note: The personal services entity’s deductions that do not relate to your
personal services income and that are not entity maintenance

deductions cannot reduce the amount included in your assessable
income under section 86-15.

##### 86-25  Apportionment of entity maintenance deductions among
##### several individuals

If, in the income year:

(a) the amount worked out under step 4 of the method statement
in section 86-20 is greater than zero; and

Note: This happens if the entity has entity maintenance deductions that
form some or all of the reduction under section 86-20.

(b) the * ordinary income or * statutory income of the * personal
services entity includes another individual’s * personal
services income (as well as your personal services income);
and

(c) the other individual’s personal services income is included in
the other individual’s assessable income under section 86-15;

the amount worked out under step 4 is taken to be:

Your personal services income
Original step 4 amount
Total personal services income


where:

**_original step 4 amount_** is the amount that would be the amount
worked out under step 4 if this section did not apply.

**_total personal services income_** is the sum of all the amounts of
personal services income (whether your personal services income
or someone else’s) that are included in the personal services
entity’s ordinary income or statutory income for the income year.

**_your personal services income_** is the sum of all the amounts of
your personal services income that are included in the personal
services entity’s ordinary income or statutory income for the
income year.

from providing the services also includes Robyn’s personal services
income of $168,000.

Because NewIT now receives the personal services income of
someone else, Ron’s step 4 amount is reduced as follows:

$120,000
$6,000 $2,500

 

$288,000

Under step 5 of the method statement in section 86-20, the amount of
the reduction under that section is therefore $52,500, and the amount
included in Ron’s assessable income is $67,500.

##### 86-27  Deduction for net personal services income loss

If your personal services deduction amount exceeds your
unreduced personal services income, then you can deduct the
excess amount. For this purpose:

(a) your **_personal services deduction amount_** is the amount of
deductions relating to your * personal services income worked
out under step 1 of the method statement in section 86-20,
increased by the amount (if greater than zero) worked out
under step 4 of the method statement; and

(b) your **_unreduced personal services income_** is the personal
services income that would have been included in your
assessable income for the income year if there had not been
any reduction under section 86-20.

##### 86-30  Assessable income etc. of the personal services entity

* Ordinary income or * statutory income of the * personal services
entity is neither assessable income nor * exempt income of the

**Division 86** Alienation of personal services income

##### Section 86-35

##### 86-35  Later payments of, or entitlements to, personal services
##### income to be disregarded for income tax purposes

(1) To the extent that a payment by the * personal services entity, or by
your * associate, is a payment to you or any of your associates of:

(a)  * personal services income included in your assessable
income under section 86-15; or

(b) any other amount that is attributable to that income;

the payment:

(c) is neither assessable income nor * exempt income of the entity
receiving it; and

Note: Subsection 118-20(4) prevents this income being treated as a
capital gain.

(d) is not an amount that the entity making it can deduct.

Note: Section 118-65 prevents this amount being treated as a capital
loss.

Example: Continuing example 2 in section 86-20: Assume that NewIT had paid
Jill, Ron’s wife, an amount for work that is not the principal work of
NewIT. The payment is made from money already included in Ron’s
assessable income under section 86-15.

The amount is neither assessable income nor exempt income of Jill,
and NewIT cannot deduct the amount.

(2) To the extent that you are entitled, or any of your * associates are
entitled, to a share of the net income of the * personal services
entity, or of any of your associates, and that income is:

(a)  * personal services income included in your assessable
income under section 86-15; or

(b) any other amount that is attributable to that income;

that share is neither assessable income nor * exempt income of the
entity receiving it or entitled to receive it.

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Personal services income **Part 2-42**

Alienation of personal services income **Division 86**

##### Section 86-40

(a) before the end of 14 July in a particular income year, you
receive, as salary or wages, * personal services income of
yours from the * personal services entity; and

(b) failure to make the payment before the end of 14 July would
have resulted in an amount of income being included in your
assessable income under section 86-15 for the preceding
income year;

you are taken to have received the payment on 30 June of that
preceding income year.

Example: Continuing example 2 in section 86-20: Assume that NewIT is a small
withholder for PAYG withholding purposes, and its PAYG payment
period covering April 2001 to June 2001 is the quarter ending on
30 June 2001. NewIT’s income for that period (after taking into
account any reductions under sections 86-20 and 86-25) includes
$20,000 that is Ron’s personal services income, and NewIT pays this
to Ron on 12 July 2001.

The $20,000 that Ron receives is assessable income for the income
year ended on 30 June 2001.

(2) However, this section does not affect the time at which the
* personal services entity is treated as having paid the salary or
wages.

Note 1: Therefore neither the timing of the entity’s deduction for the payment,
nor the timing of the obligation to withhold amounts under
section 12-35 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ ,
is affected.

Note 2: However, these payments are treated as relating to the preceding
income year for the purposes of the rules relating to payment
summaries, PAYG credits and PAYG withholding non-compliance
tax (see Subdivisions 16-C, 18-A and 18-D in Schedule 1 to the
_Taxation Administration Act 1953_ ).

##### 86-60  General rule for deduction entitlements of personal services
##### entities

A * personal services entity cannot deduct under this Act an amount
to the extent that it relates to gaining or producing an individual’s
* personal services income, unless:

(a) the individual could have deducted the amount under this Act
if the circumstances giving rise to the entity’s entitlement to
deduct the amount had applied instead to the individual; or

Note: In particular, Division 85 specifies limits on an individual’s
entitlements to deductions relating to the individual’s personal
services income.

(b) the entity receives the individual’s * personal services income
in the course of conducting a * personal services business.

##### 86-65  Entity maintenance deductions

(1) Section 86-60 does not stop a * personal services entity deducting
an amount to the extent that it is an * entity maintenance deduction.

Note: See section 86-25 for how entity maintenance deductions are offset
against a personal services entity’s income.

(2) Each of these is an **_entity maintenance deduction_** :

(a) any fee or charge payable by the entity for opening, operating
or closing an account with an * ADI;

(b) any deduction under section 25-5 (about tax-related
expenses);

(c) any loss or outgoing incurred in relation to preparation or
lodgment of any document the entity is required to lodge
under the _Corporations Act 2001_ ;

##### Section 86-70

(d) any fee or charge payable by the entity to an * Australian
government agency for any licence, permission, approval,
authorisation, registration or certification (however
described) that is granted or given under an * Australian law.

(3) However, paragraph (2)(c) does not include any payment that the
entity makes to an * associate.

##### 86-70  Car expenses

_Cars used solely for business_

(1) Section 86-60 does not stop a * personal services entity deducting a
* car expense for a * car of which there is no * private use.

_Other cars_

(2) Section 86-60 does not stop a * personal services entity deducting:

(a) a * car expense; or

(b) an amount of tax payable under the _Fringe Benefits Tax_
_Assessment Act 1986_ for a * car fringe benefit;

for a * car of which there is * private use. However, there cannot be,
at the same time, more than one car for which such deductions can
arise in relation to gaining or producing the same individual’s
* personal services income.

(3) If there is more than one * car to which subsection (2) could apply
at the same time, the entity must choose the car to which
subsection (2) applies at that time. The choice remains in effect
until the entity ceases to * hold that car.

Example: Continuing example 2 in section 86-20: Assume that NewIT provides
3 cars to Ron. Car 1 is used solely for business purposes and cars 2
and 3 are used for private purposes.

NewIT can deduct all the car expenses it incurs for car 1. It can also
deduct all the car expenses it incurs for its choice of either car 2 or car
3, as well as the fringe benefits tax it pays for that car. However, it
cannot deduct any car expenses or fringe benefits tax for the car that it
does not choose.

##### Section 86-75

Note: If car expenses for a car are not deductible because of section 86-60,
the car benefit being provided is an exempt benefit for the purposes of
fringe benefits tax: see subsection 8(4) of the _Fringe Benefits Tax_
_Assessment Act 1986_ .

##### 86-75  Superannuation

(1) Section 86-60 does not stop a * personal services entity deducting a
contribution the entity makes to a fund or an * RSA for the purpose
of making provision for * superannuation benefits payable for an
individual whose * personal services income is included in the
entity’s * ordinary income or * statutory income.

For deductions for superannuation contributions: see Subdivision AA of
Division 3 of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

(2) However, if:

(a) the individual performs less than 20% (by * market value) of
the entity’s principal work; and

(b) the individual is an * associate of another individual whose
* personal services income is included in the entity’s
* ordinary income or * statutory income;

the entity’s deduction cannot exceed the amount it would have to
contribute, for the benefit of the individual, to a * complying
superannuation fund or an * RSA in order to ensure that it did not
have any * individual superannuation guarantee shortfalls in respect
of the individual for any of the * quarters in the income year.

(3) To work out the amount the entity would have to contribute for the
purposes of subsection (2), the individual’s salary or wages, for the
purposes of the _Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act_
_1992_ , are taken to be the amount that section 86-60 does not
prevent the entity deducting for salary or wages it paid to the
individual.

Note: Section 86-60 will apply the limitations under sections 85-10 and
85-20 on an individual’s entitlement to deductions (but see
paragraph 85-10(2)(e) on employment of associates).

##### 87-1  What this Division is about

Divisions 85 and 86 do not apply to personal services income that
is income from conducting a personal services business.

It is not intended that the Divisions apply to independent
contractors.

A personal services business exists if there is a personal services
business determination or if one or more of 4 tests for what is a
personal services business are met.

Regardless of how much of your personal services income is paid
from one source, you can self-assess against the results test to
determine whether you are an independent contractor. The results
test is based on the traditional tests for determining independent
contractors and it is intended that it apply accordingly.

However, you cannot “self-assess” whether you meet any of the
other 3 tests if 80% or more of your personal services income is
from one source. In these cases, you need a personal services
business determination in order to be treated as conducting a
personal services business.

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Personal services income **Part 2-42**

Personal services businesses **Division 87**

##### Section 87-30

##### 87-30  The business premises test for a personal services business

(1) An individual or a * personal services entity meets the business
premises test in an income year if, at all times during the income
year, the individual or entity maintains and uses business premises:

(a) at which the individual or entity mainly conducts activities
from which * personal services income is gained or produced;
and

(b) of which the individual or entity has exclusive use; and

(c) that are physically separate from any premises that the
individual or entity, or any * associate of the individual or
entity, uses for private purposes; and

(d) that are physically separate from the premises of the entity to
which the individual or entity provides services and from the
premises of any associate of the entity to which the
individual or entity provides services.

(2) The individual or entity need not maintain and use the same
business premises throughout the income year.

##### 87-35  Personal services income from Australian government
##### agencies

(1)  * Australian government agencies are not treated as * associates of
each other for the purposes of subsection 87-15(3) and
paragraph 87-20(1)(a).

Example: You receive 60% of your personal services income from a Department
of a State government and 40% of your personal services income from
a corporation in which that State has a majority shareholding.

You are not treated as if 80% or more of your personal services
income is income from the same entity and that entity’s associates,
and therefore you will not need a personal services business
determination to satisfy subsection 87-15(3).

In addition, you satisfy the first limb (but not necessarily the second
limb) of the unrelated clients test in subsection 87-20(1), because you
receive your personal services income from 2 entities that are not
treated as associates of each other.

##### Section 87-40

(2) Each Agency within the meaning of the _Public Service Act 1999_ :

(a) is treated as a separate entity; and

(b) is not treated as an * associate of any other such Agency, or of
any * Australian government agency;

for the purposes of subsection 87-15(3) and paragraph 87-20(1)(a).

Example: You receive 70% of your personal services income from the
Commonwealth Department of Treasury and 30% of your personal
services income from the Australian Taxation Office (neither body has
a legal identity separate from the Commonwealth Government).

You are not treated as if 80% or more of your personal services
income is income from the same entity, or from the same entity and
that entity’s associates, and therefore you will not need a personal
services business determination to satisfy subsection 87-15(3).

In addition, you satisfy the first limb (but not necessarily the second
limb) of the unrelated clients test in subsection 87-20(1), because you
receive your personal services income from 2 bodies that are treated
as separate entities and that are not treated as associates of each other.

(3) Each part of the government of a State or Territory, and each part
of an authority of the State or Territory, that has, under a law of the
State or Territory, a status corresponding to an Agency within the
meaning of the _Public Service Act 1999_ :

(a) is treated as a separate entity; and

(b) is not treated as an * associate of any other part of such a
government or authority, or of any * Australian government
agency;

for the purposes of subsection 87-15(3) and paragraph 87-20(1)(a).

##### 87-40  Application of this Division to certain agents

##### 100-5  Effect of this Division

This Division is a * Guide.

Note: In interpreting an operative provision, a Guide may be considered
only for limited purposes: see section 950-150.

##### 100-10  Fundamentals of CGT

(1) CGT affects your income tax liability because your assessable
income includes your net capital gain for the income year. Your net
capital gain is the total of your capital gains for the income year,
reduced by certain capital losses you have made.

See later in this Guide (section 100-50) for more detail.

(2) When you prepare your income tax return, you need to check
whether you have made any capital gains for the income year.

You also need to check whether you have made any capital losses.
You cannot deduct a capital loss from your assessable income, but
it will reduce your capital gain in the current income year or later
income years.

(3) You will also need to consider the impact of CGT when doing your
financial planning. In particular, you will need adequate
record-keeping to deal most effectively with any immediate or
future CGT liability.

To give you a sense of the range of things affected by CGT, if you
are involved with any of the following, you may have a CGT
liability now or at some time in the future:

- - leases - - marriage or relationship
breakdown

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

A Guide to capital gains and losses **Division 100**

##### Section 100-20

#### Step 1—Have you made a capital gain or a capital loss?

##### 100-20  What events attract CGT?

(1) You can make a capital gain or loss _only if_ a CGT event happens.

(2) There are a wide range of CGT events. Some happen often and
affect many different taxpayers. Others are rare and affect only a
few.

**Some examples of CGT events**

**Situation** **Event** **Which CGT event?**

You sell them CGT event A1

You own shares you acquired
on or after 20 September 1985

CGT event D1

You sell a business You agree with the
purchaser not to operate a
similar business in the
same area

CGT event F5

You are a lessor You receive a payment
for changing the lease

CGT event G1

You own shares in a company The company makes a
payment (not a dividend)
to you as a shareholder

A summary of all the CGT events is in section 104-5.

_Identifying the time of a CGT event_

(3) The specific time when a CGT event happens is important for
various reasons: in particular, for working out whether a capital
gain or loss from the event affects your income tax for the current
or another income year.

If a CGT event involves a contract, the time of the event will often
be when the contract is _made_ , not when it is completed.

The time of each CGT event is explained early in
the relevant section in Division 104.

**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 100** A Guide to capital gains and losses

##### Section 100-25

##### 100-25  What are CGT assets?

(1) Most CGT events involve a CGT asset. (For many, there is an
_exception_ if the CGT asset was acquired _before_ 20 September
1985.) However, many CGT events are concerned directly with
capital receipts and do _not_ involve a CGT asset.

See the summary of the CGT events in section 104-5.

(2) Some CGT assets are reasonably well-known:

- land and buildings, for example, a weekender;

- shares;

- units in a unit trust;

- collectables which cost over $500, for example, jewellery
or an artwork;

- personal use assets which cost over $10,000, for example,
a boat.

(3) Other CGT assets are not so well-known. For example:

- your home;

- contractual rights;

- goodwill;

- foreign currency.

For a full explanation of what things are CGT assets: see Division 108.

##### 100-30  Does an exception or exemption apply?

(1) Once you identify a CGT event which applies to you, you need to
know if there is an exception or exemption that would reduce the
capital gain or loss or allow you to disregard it.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

A Guide to capital gains and losses **Division 100**

##### Section 100-33

(2) There are 4 categories of exemptions:

1. exempt assets: for example, cars;
2. exempt or loss-denying transactions: for example,
compensation for personal injury or your tenancy comes to
an end;

3. anti-overlap provisions (that reduce your capital gain by the
amount that is otherwise assessable);

4. small business relief.

Note: Most of the exceptions are in Division 104. You will find most of the
possible exemptions in Division 118. The small business relief
provisions are in Division 152.

_Some exemptions are limited_

(3) Take the family home for example. Generally, you are exempt
from CGT when you make a capital gain on disposing of your
main residence.

But this can change depending on how you came to own the house
and what you have done with it. For example, if you rent it out,
you may be liable to CGT when you sell it.

For the limits on the general exemption of your main residence:
see Subdivision 118-B.

##### 100-33  Can there be a roll-over?

(1) Roll-overs allow you to defer or disregard a capital gain or loss
from a CGT event. They apply in specific situations. Some require
a choice (for example, where an asset is compulsorily acquired: see
Subdivision 124-B) and some are automatic (for example, where
an asset is transferred because of marriage or relationship
breakdown: see Subdivision 126-A).

(2) There are 2 types of roll-over:

1. a _replacement-asset roll-over_ allows you to defer a capital
gain or loss from one CGT event until a later CGT event
happens where a CGT asset is replaced with another one;

**Division 100** A Guide to capital gains and losses

##### Section 100-35

2. a _same-asset roll-over_ allows you to disregard a capital gain
or loss from a CGT event where the same CGT asset is
involved.

Note: The replacement-asset roll-overs are listed in section 112-115, and the
same-asset roll-overs are listed in section 112-150.

#### Step 2—Work out the amount of the capital gain or loss

##### 100-35  What is a capital gain or loss?

For most CGT events:

- You make a capital gain if you receive (or are entitled to
receive) capital amounts from the CGT event which exceed
your total costs associated with that event.

- You make a capital loss if your total costs associated with
the CGT event exceed the capital amounts you receive (or
are entitled to receive) from the event.

##### 100-40  What factors come into calculating a capital gain or loss?

_Capital proceeds_

(1) For most CGT events, the capital amounts you receive (or are
entitled to receive) from the event are called the **_capital proceeds_** .

To work out the capital proceeds: see Division 116.

_Cost base and reduced cost base_

(2) For most CGT events, your total costs associated with the event are
worked out in 2 different ways:

### - For the purpose of working out a capital _gain_ , those costs
are called the **_cost base_** of the CGT asset.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

A Guide to capital gains and losses **Division 100**

##### Section 100-45

### - For the purpose of working out a capital _loss_ , those costs
are called the **_reduced cost base_** of the asset.

One of the main differences is that the costs may be indexed for
inflation occurring before 1 October 1999 in working out a capital
_gain_ for a CGT asset acquired at or before 11.45 am on
21 September 1999 (which reduces the size of the gain), but not in
working out a capital _loss_ .

To work out the cost base and reduced cost base: see Division 110.

##### 100-45  How to calculate the capital gain or loss for most CGT events

1. Work out your capital proceeds from the CGT event.

2. Work out the cost base for the CGT asset.

3. Subtract the cost base from the capital proceeds.

4. If the proceeds exceed the cost base, the difference is your capital
_gain_ .

5. If not, work out the reduced cost base for the asset.

6. If the reduced cost base exceeds the capital proceeds, the
difference is your capital _loss_ .

7. If the capital proceeds are less than the cost base but more than the
reduced cost base, you have neither a capital _gain_ nor a capital
_loss_ .

#### Step 3—Work out your net capital gain or loss for the income
#### year

##### 100-50  How to work out your net capital gain or loss

1. Reduce your capital gains for the income year, in the order you
choose, by your capital losses for the income year. (If the capital
losses for the income year exceed the capital gains, the difference

is your net capital loss. You cannot deduct a net capital loss from
your assessable income.)

2. Reduce any remaining capital gains, in the order you choose, by
any unapplied net capital losses for previous income years.

3. Reduce any remaining discount capital gains by the discount
percentage.

To find out what is a discount capital gain and the discount percentage:
see Division 115.

4. If you carry on a small business, apply the small business
concessions in further reduction of your capital gains (whether or
not the gains are discount capital gains).

For the small business concessions:
see Division 152.

5. Add up:

(a) any remaining capital gains that are not discount capital
gains; and

(b) any remaining discount capital gains.

The total is your net capital gain.

For the rules on working out your _net_ capital gain or loss:
see Division 102.

##### 100-55  How do you comply with CGT?

Declare any net capital gain as assessable income in your income
tax return.

Defer any net capital loss to the next income year for which you
have capital gains that exceed the capital losses for that income
year.

#### Keeping records for CGT purposes

##### 100-60  Why keep records?

1. To ensure you do not disadvantage yourself.

##### Section 102-1

### Division 102—Assessable income includes net capital gain


#### Guide to Division 102

##### 102-1  What this Division is about

This Division tells you how to work out if you have made a net
capital gain or a net capital loss for the income year. A net capital
gain is included in your assessable income. However, you cannot
deduct a net capital loss. (Amounts otherwise included in your
assessable income do not form part of a net capital gain.)

##### 102-3  Concessions in working out your net capital gain

(1) Concessional rules apply to working out the net capital gain of
some entities (see subsection (2)) if:

(a) they have a capital gain (a **_discount capital gain_** ) from a
CGT asset acquired at least 12 months before the CGT event
that caused the capital gain; and

(b) they have not chosen to include indexation in the cost base of
the asset for working out the capital gain (if relevant).

Note 1: Division 115 explains what is a discount capital gain.

Note 2: Under Division 110, the entity can choose to include indexation in the
cost base of a CGT asset acquired at or before 11.45 am on
21 September 1999.

(2) Only these entities get the concession:

(a) individuals;

(b) complying superannuation entities;

(c) trusts;

(d) life insurance companies, in relation to discount capital gains
for CGT events in respect of CGT assets that are complying
superannuation assets.

**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 102** Assessable income includes net capital gain

##### Section 102-5

Note 2: Some provisions of this Act (such as Divisions 104 and
118) permit or require you to disregard certain capital
gains or losses when working out your net capital gain.
Subdivision 152-B permits you, in some circumstances,
to disregard a capital gain on an asset you held for at
least 15 years.

Step 2. Apply any previously unapplied * net capital losses from
earlier income years to reduce the amounts (if any)
remaining after the reduction of * capital gains under step
1 (including any capital gains not reduced under that step
because the * capital losses were less than the total of your
capital gains).

Note 1: Section 102-15 explains how to apply net capital losses.

Note 2: You choose the order in which you reduce the amounts.

Step 3. Reduce by the * discount percentage each amount of a
* discount capital gain remaining after step 2 (if any).

Note: Only some entities can have discount capital gains, and
only if they have capital gains from CGT assets acquired
at least a year before making the gains. See
Division 115.

Step 4. If any of your * capital gains (whether or not they are
* discount capital gains) qualify for any of the small
business concessions in Subdivisions 152-C, 152-D and
152-E, apply those concessions to each capital gain as
provided for in those Subdivisions.

Note 1: The basic conditions for getting these concessions are in
Subdivision 152-A.

Note 2: Subdivision 152-C does not apply to CGT events J2, J5
and J6. In addition, Subdivision 152-E does not apply to
CGT events J5 and J6.

Step 5. Add up the amounts of * capital gains (if any) remaining
after step 4. The sum is your **_net capital gain_** for the
income year.

Note: For exceptions and modifications to these rules: see section 102-30.

(2) However, if during the income year:

(a) you became bankrupt; or

(b) you were released from debts under a law relating to
bankruptcy;

any * net capital loss you made for an earlier income year must be
disregarded in working out whether you made a * net capital gain
for the income year or a later one.

(3) Subsection (2) applies even though your bankruptcy is annulled if:

(a) the annulment happens under section 74 of the _Bankruptcy_
_Act 1966_ ; and

(b) under the composition or scheme of arrangement concerned,
you were, will be or may be released from debts from which
you would have been released if instead you had been
discharged from the bankruptcy.

##### 102-10  How to work out your net capital loss

(1) You work out if you have a **_net capital loss_** for the income year in
this way:

Step 1. Add up the * capital losses you made during the income
year. Also add up the * capital gains you made.

Step 2. Subtract your * capital gains from your * capital losses.

Step 3. If the Step 2 amount is _more than_ zero, __ it is your **_net_**
**_capital loss_** for the income year.

Note: For exceptions and modifications to these rules: see section 102-30.

(2) You _cannot_ deduct from your assessable income a * net capital loss
for any income year.

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 102** Assessable income includes net capital gain

##### Section 102-15

##### 102-15  How to apply net capital losses

In working out if you have a * net capital gain, your * net capital
losses are applied in the order in which you made them.

Note 1: A net capital loss can be applied only to the extent that it has not
already been utilised: see subsection 960-20(1).

Note 2: For applying a net capital loss for the 1997-98 income year or an
earlier income year, see section 102-15 of the _Income Tax_
_(Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ .

##### 102-20  Ways you can make a capital gain or a capital loss

You can make a * capital gain or * capital loss if and only if a * CGT
event happens. The gain or loss is made at the time of the event.

Note 1: The full list of CGT events is in section 104-5.

Note 2: The gain or loss may be affected by an exemption, or may be able to
be rolled-over. For exemptions generally, see Division 118. For
roll-overs, see Divisions 122, 123, 124 and 126.

Note 3: You may make a capital gain or capital loss as a result of a CGT event
happening to another entity: see subsections 115-215(3), 170-275(1)
and 170-280(3).

Note 4: You cannot make a capital loss from a CGT event that happens to
your original interests during a trust restructuring period if you choose
a roll-over under Subdivision 124-N.

Note 5: The capital loss may be affected if the CGT asset was owned by a
member of a demerger group just before a demerger: see
section 125-170.

Note 6: Under subsection 230-310(4) gains and losses are taken to arise from
a CGT event in particular circumstances.

Note 7: This section does not apply in relation to the capital gain mentioned in
paragraph 294-120(5)(b) of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions)_
_Act 1997_ .

##### 102-22  Amounts of capital gains and losses

Most * CGT events provide for calculating a * capital gain or
* capital loss by comparing 2 different amounts. The amount of the
gain or loss is the difference between those amounts.

Assessable income includes net capital gain **Division 102**

##### Section 102-23

##### 102-23  CGT event still happens even if gain or loss disregarded

A * CGT event still happens even if:

(a) it does not result in a * capital gain or * capital loss; or

(b) a capital gain or capital loss from the event is disregarded.

Example: Lindy sells a car. Section 118-5 says that any capital gain or loss from
a CGT event happening to a car is disregarded. However, the sale is
still an example of CGT event A1.

##### 102-25  Order of application of CGT events

(1) Work out if a * CGT event (except * CGT events D1 and H2)
happens to your situation. If more than one event can happen, the
one you use is the one that is the most specific to your situation.

(2) However, there are 3 exceptions: one for * CGT event J2, one for
CGT event K5 and one for CGT event K12.

(2A) If the circumstances that gave rise to * CGT event J2 constitute
another CGT event, CGT event J2 applies in addition to the other
event.

Example: CGT event J2 happens because a replacement asset for a small
business roll-over under Subdivision 152-E becomes your trading
stock (in circumstances where CGT event K4 happens). Both CGT
events apply.

(2B)  * CGT event K5 happens if CGT event A1, C2 or E8 happens. CGT
event K5 applies in addition to the other event.

(2C) If:

(a)  * CGT events happen for which you make * capital gains or
* capital losses; and

(b) the capital gains or losses are taken into account in working
out a * foreign hybrid net capital loss amount; and

(c) the foreign hybrid net capital loss amount is itself taken into
account in determining that * CGT event K12 happens;

CGT event K12 applies in addition to the other CGT events.

(3) If no * CGT event (except * CGT events D1 and H2) happens:

Note: Subsection 230-310(4) (which deals with hedging financial
arrangements) provides that in certain circumstances a CGT event is
taken to have occurred in relation to a hedging financial arrangement
at the same time as a CGT event actually occurs in relation to a
hedged item covered by the arrangement.

#### Subdivision 104-A—Disposals

##### 104-10  Disposal of a CGT asset: CGT event A1

(1) **_CGT event A1_** happens if you * dispose of a * CGT asset.

(2) You **_dispose of_** a * CGT asset if a change of ownership occurs from
you to another entity, whether because of some act or event or by
operation of law. However, a change of ownership does not occur
if you stop being the legal owner of the asset but continue to be its
beneficial owner.

Note: A change in the trustee of a trust does not constitute a change in the
entity that is the trustee of the trust (see subsection 960-100(2)). This
means that CGT event A1 will not happen merely because of a change
in the trustee.

(3) The time of the event is:

(a) when you enter into the contract for the * disposal; or

(b) if there is no contract—when the change of ownership
occurs.

Example: In June 1999 you enter into a contract to sell land. The contract is
settled in October 1999. You make a capital gain of $50,000.

CGT events **Division 104**

##### Section 104-10

The gain is made in the 1998-99 income year (the year you entered
into the contract) and not the 1999-2000 income year (the year that
settlement takes place).

Note 1: If the contract falls through before completion, this event does not
happen because no change in ownership occurs.

Note 2: If the asset was compulsorily acquired from you: see subsection (6).

(4) You make a **_capital gain_** if the * capital proceeds from the disposal
are _more_ than the asset’s * cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if
those capital proceeds are _less_ than the asset’s * reduced cost base.

(a) you * acquired the asset before 20 September 1985; or

(b) for a lease that you granted:

(i) it was granted before that day; or

(ii) if it has been renewed or extended—the start of the last
renewal or extension occurred before that day.

Note 1: You can make a gain if you dispose of shares in a company, or an
interest in a trust, that you acquired before that day: see CGT event
K6.

Note 2: A capital gain or loss you make because you assign a right under or in
relation to a general insurance policy you held with an HIH company
to the Commonwealth, the trustee of the HIH Trust or a prescribed
entity is also disregarded: see section 322-15.

Note 3: A capital gain or loss made by a demerging entity from CGT event A1
happening as a result of a demerger is also disregarded: see
section 125-155.

Note 4: A capital gain or loss you make because of section 16AI of the
_Banking Act 1959_ is disregarded: see section 253-10 of this Act.
Section 16AI of the _Banking Act 1959_ :
(a) reduces your right to be paid an amount by an ADI in connection
with an account to the extent of your entitlement under
Division 2AA of Part II of that Act to be paid an amount by
APRA; and

(b) provides that, to the extent of the reduction, the right becomes a
right of APRA.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

CGT events **Division 104**

##### Section 104-35

Example: You enter into a contract with the purchaser of your business not to
operate a similar business in the same town. The contract states that
$20,000 was paid for this.

You have created a contractual right in favour of the purchaser. If you
breach the contract, the purchaser can enforce that right.

(2) The time of the event is when you enter into the contract or create
the other right.

(3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the * capital proceeds from creating the
right are _more_ than the * incidental costs you incurred that relate to
the event. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are
_less_ .

Example: To continue the example: If you paid your lawyer $1,500 to draw up
the contract, you make a capital gain of:

$20,000 –  $1,500 = $18,500

(4) The costs can include giving property: see section 103-5. However,
they do not include an amount you have received as * recoupment
of them and that is not included in your assessable income, or an
amount to the extent that you have deducted or can deduct it.

_Exceptions_

(5) **_CGT event D1_** does not happen if:

(a) you created the right by borrowing money or obtaining credit
from another entity; or

(b) the right requires you to do something that is another * CGT
event that happens to you; or

(c) a company issues or allots * equity interests or * non-equity
shares in the company; or

(d) the trustee of a unit trust issues units in the trust; or

##### Section 104-40

(g) you created the right by creating in another entity a right to
receive an * exploration benefit under a * farm-in farm-out
arrangement.

Example: You agree to sell land. You have created a contractual right in the
buyer to enforce completion of the transaction. The sale results in you
disposing of the land, an example of CGT event A1. This means that
CGT event D1 does not happen.

##### 104-40  Granting an option: CGT event D2

(1) **_CGT event D2_** happens if you grant an option to an entity, or
renew or extend an option you had granted.

Note: Some options are not covered: see subsections (6) and (7).

(2) The time of the event is when you grant, renew or extend the
option.

(3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the * capital proceeds from the grant,
renewal or extension of the option are _more_ than the expenditure
you incurred to grant, renew or extend it. You make a **_capital loss_** 
if those capital proceeds are _less_ .

(4) The expenditure can include giving property: see section 103-5.
However, it does not include an amount you have received as
* recoupment of it and that is not included in your assessable
income, or an amount to the extent that you have deducted or can
deduct it.

_Exceptions_

(5) A * capital gain or * capital loss you make from the grant, renewal or
extension of the option is disregarded if the option is exercised.

Note 1: Section 134-1 sets out the consequences of an option being exercised.

Note 2: A capital gain or capital loss you made for the 1997-98 income year or
an earlier income year under former Part IIIA of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ is also disregarded where the option is exercised
in the 1998-99 income year or a later one: see section 104-40 of the
_Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ .

##### Section 104-45

(6) This section does not apply to an option granted, renewed or
extended by a company or the trustee of a unit trust to * acquire a
* CGT asset that is:

(a)  * shares in the company or units in the unit trust; or

(b) debentures of the company or unit trust.

Note: Section 104-30 deals with this situation.

(7) Nor does it apply to an option relating to a * personal use asset or a
* collectable.

##### 104-45  Granting a right to income from mining: CGT event D3

(1) **_CGT event D3_** happens if you own a * prospecting entitlement or
* mining entitlement, or an interest in one, and you grant another
entity a right to receive * ordinary income or * statutory income from
operations permitted to be carried on by the entitlement.

Note: If this event applies, there is no disposal of the entitlement.

(2) The time of the event is:

(a) when you enter into the contract with the other entity; or

(b) if there is no contract—when you grant the right to receive
* ordinary income or * statutory income.

(3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the * capital proceeds from the grant of
the right are _more_ than the expenditure you incurred in granting it.
You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital proceeds are _less_ .

(4) The expenditure can include giving property: see section 103-5.
However, it does not include an amount you have received as
* recoupment of it and that is not included in your assessable
income, or an amount to the extent that you have deducted or can
deduct it.

##### 104-47  Conservation covenants: CGT event D4

(1) **_CGT event D4_** happens if you enter into a * conservation covenant
over land you own.

**Division 104** CGT events

##### Section 104-47

(2) The time of the event is when you enter into the covenant.

(3) You make a * capital gain if the * capital proceeds from entering into
the covenant are _more_ than that part of the * cost base of the land
that is apportioned to the covenant. You make a * capital loss if
those capital proceeds are _less_ than the part of the * reduced cost
base of the land that is apportioned to the covenant.

Note: The capital proceeds from entering into the covenant are modified if
you do not receive anything for entering into the covenant: see
section 116-105.

(4) The part of the * cost base of the land that is apportioned to the
covenant is worked out in this way:



*Capital proceeds from entering into the covenant
*Cost base of land
Those capital proceeds plus the *market value

of the land just after you enter into the covenant

The part of the * reduced cost base of the land that is apportioned to
the covenant is worked out similarly.

(5) The * cost base and * reduced cost base of the land are reduced by
the part of the cost base or reduced cost base of the land that is
apportioned to the covenant.

Example: Lisa receives $10,000 for entering into a conservation covenant that
covers 15% of the land she owns. Lisa uses the following figures in
calculating the cost base of the land that is apportioned to the
covenant:

The cost base of the entire land is $200,000.

The market value of the entire land before entering into the covenant
is $300,000, and its market value after entering into the covenant is
$285,000.

Lisa calculates the cost base of the land that is apportioned to the
covenant to be:

$200,000 10,000 10,000 285,000 $6,780
 
     
 

She reduces the cost base of the land by the part that is apportioned to
the covenant:

##### 104-55  Creating a trust over a CGT asset: CGT event E1

(1) **_CGT event E1_** happens if you create a trust over a * CGT asset by
declaration or settlement.

Note: A change in the trustee of a trust does not constitute a change in the
entity that is the trustee of the trust (see subsection 960-100(2)). This
means that CGT event E1 will not happen merely because of a change
in the trustee.

(2) The time of the event is when the trust over the asset is created.

(3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the * capital proceeds from the creation
are _more_ than the asset’s * cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if
those capital proceeds are _less_ than the asset’s * reduced cost base.

_Cost base rule_

(4) If you are the trustee of the trust and no beneficiary is absolutely
entitled to the asset as against you (disregarding any legal
disability), the first element of the asset’s * cost base and * reduced
cost base in your hands is its * market value when the trust is
created.

_Exceptions_

(5) **_CGT event E1_** does not happen if you are the sole beneficiary of
the trust and:

(a) you are absolutely entitled to the asset as against the trustee
(disregarding any legal disability); and

(b) the trust is not a unit trust.

(6) A * capital gain or * capital loss you make is disregarded if you
* acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

##### Section 104-60

##### 104-60  Transferring a CGT asset to a trust: CGT event E2

(1) **_CGT event E2_** happens if you transfer a * CGT asset to an existing
trust.

Note: A change in the trustee of a trust does not constitute a change in the
entity that is the trustee of the trust (see subsection 960-100(2)). This
means that CGT event E2 will not happen merely because of a change
in the trustee.

(2) The time of the event is when the asset is transferred.

(3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the * capital proceeds from the transfer
are _more_ than the asset’s * cost base. You make a **_capital loss_** if
those capital proceeds are _less_ than the asset’s * reduced cost base.

(4) If you are the trustee of the trust and no beneficiary is absolutely
entitled to the asset as against you (disregarding any legal
disability), the first element of the asset’s * cost base and * reduced
cost base in your hands is its * market value when the asset is

(a) you are absolutely entitled to the asset as against the trustee
(disregarding any legal disability); and

(b) the trust is not a unit trust.

* acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

##### 104-65  Converting a trust to a unit trust: CGT event E3

##### Section 104-70

(b) just before the conversion, a beneficiary under the trust was
absolutely entitled to the asset as against the trustee
(disregarding any legal disability the beneficiary is under).

(2) The time of the event is when the trust is converted.

(3) The beneficiary makes a **_capital gain_** if the * market value of the
asset (when the trust is converted) is _more_ than the asset’s * cost
base. The beneficiary makes a **_capital loss_** if that market value is
_less_ than the asset’s * reduced cost base.

_Exception_

(4) A * capital gain or * capital loss the beneficiary makes is disregarded
if it * acquired the asset before 20 September 1985.

##### 104-70  Capital payment for trust interest: CGT event E4

(1) **_CGT event E4_** happens if:

(a) the trustee of a trust makes a payment to you in respect of
your unit or your interest in the trust (except for * CGT event
A1, C2, E1, E2, E6 or E7 happening in relation to it); and

(b) some or all of the payment (the **_non-assessable part_** ) is not
included in your assessable income.

To avoid doubt, in applying paragraph (b) to work out what part of
the payment is included in your assessable income, disregard your
share of the trust’s net income that is subject to the rules in
subsection 115-215(3).

Note 1: Subsections 104-71(1) (tax-exempted amounts), 104-71(3) (tax-free
amounts) and 104-71(4) (CGT concession amounts) can affect the
calculation of the non-assessable part.

Note 2: The non-assessable part includes amounts (tax-deferred amounts)
associated with the small business 50% reduction, frozen indexation,
building allowance and accounting differences in income.

Note 3: A payment made to you after you stop owning the unit or interest in
the trust forms part of the capital proceeds for the CGT event that
happened when you stopped owning it.

CGT events **Division 104**

##### Section 104-70

(1A) However, **_CGT event E4_** does not happen if the unit or interest
mentioned in subsection (1) is a unit or interest in an * AMIT.

(2) The payment can include giving property (see section 103-5).

(3) The time of the event is:

(a) just before the end of the income year in which the trustee
makes the payment; or

(b) if another * CGT event (except CGT event E4) happens in
relation to the unit or interest or part of it after the trustee
makes the payment but before the end of that income year—
just before the time of that other CGT event.

(4) You make a **_capital gain_** if the sum of the amounts of the
non-assessable parts of the payments made in the income year
made by the trustee in respect of the unit or interest is _more_ than its
* cost base.

Note: You cannot make a capital loss.

(5) If you make a * capital gain, the * cost base and * reduced cost base
of the unit or interest are reduced to nil.

Note: A capital gain under former section 160ZM of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ is also taken into account for the purposes of this
subsection: see subsection 104-70(3) of the _Income Tax (Transitional_
_Provisions) Act 1997_ .

(6) However, if that sum is not more than the * cost base:

(a) the cost base is reduced by that sum; and

(b) the * reduced cost base is reduced by that sum (without the
adjustment in subsection 104-71(3)).

Example: Mandy owns units in a unit trust that she bought on 1 July 1998 for
$10 each. During the 1999-2000 income year the trustee makes 4
non-assessable payments of $0.50 per unit. If at the end of the income
year Mandy’s cost base for each unit (including indexation) would
otherwise be $10.10, the payments require that it be reduced by $2,
giving a new cost base of $8.10. If Mandy sells the units (CGT event
A1) in the 2000-01 year for more than their cost base at that time, she
will make a capital gain equal to the difference.

is a roll-over under that Subdivision for CGT event E4 happening as a
result of a demerger.

(7) A * capital gain you make from * CGT event E4 is disregarded if
you * acquired the * CGT asset that is the unit or interest before

* ordinary income or * statutory income from sources other than an
* Australian source. However, this exception does not apply if the
trust is a * public trading trust.

##### 104-71  Adjustment of non-assessable part

(1) In working out the non-assessable part referred to in
section 104-70, disregard any part of the payment that is:

(a)  * non-assessable non-exempt income; or
(c) paid from an amount that has been assessed to the trustee; or

(d) paid from an amount that is * personal services income
included in your assessable income, or another entity’s
assessable income, under section 86-15; or

(da) a payment to which paragraph 118-37(1)(ba) applies (about
compensation paid through a trust); or

(db) a payment to which subsection 118-300(1A) applies (about
insurance and annuity payments paid through a trust); or

(e) repaid by you; or

(f) compensation you paid that can reasonably be regarded as a
repayment of all or part of the payment; or

(g) an amount referred to in section 152-125 (which exempts a
payment of a small business 15-year exemption amount) as
an exempt amount.

In applying the rules in Subdivision 115-C of the _Income Tax_

_Assessment Act 1936_ ). It is further reduced by $50 under item 1 of the
table and $5 under item 3. Claude’s non-assessable part is $20.

Effectively, CGT event E4 applies to the $20 small business 50%
reduction allowed to Claude in applying Subdivision 115-C of the
_Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ .

Note 1: Step 3 of the method statement in subsection 102-5(1) (see table
item 1) reduces by 50% the trust’s discount capital gains remaining
after applying capital losses and earlier net capital losses. That 50% is
excluded from the trust’s net capital gain.

Note 2: Subdivision 152-C (small business 50% reduction—see table items 2,
3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) reduces by 50% the trust’s capital gains or discount
capital gains remaining after applying step 3 of the method statement
in subsection 102-5(1). That 50% is also excluded from the trust’s net
capital gain.

Note 3: Paragraph 115-215(3)(b) or (c) (see table items 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) treats
a beneficiary as having an extra capital gain if an amount of the trust’s
net income that is included in the beneficiary’s assessable income is
attributable to trust gains that were reduced by step 3 of the method
statement in subsection 102-5(1) and/or the small business 50%
reduction.

(5) A **_chain of trusts_** consists of 2 or more trusts where at least one of
these conditions is satisfied for each of the trusts:

(a) the trustee of the trust owns units or interests in another of
the trusts; or

(b) the trustee of another of the trusts owns units or interests in
the trust.

(6) Item 7 of the table in subsection (4) does not apply if the entity
making the payment is a * managed investment trust.

##### 104-72  Reducing your capital gain under CGT event E4 if you are a
##### trustee

(1) A * capital gain you make under subsection 104-70(4) is reduced if:

(a) you are the trustee of another trust that is a * fixed trust and is
not a * complying superannuation entity; and

##### Section 104-95

(2) The **_net asset amount_** is worked out in this way:

_Working out the net asset amount_

Step 1. Work out the total of the * cost bases (at the time of the
disposal) of the * CGT assets that the trustee * acquired on
or after 20 September 1985 and that formed part of the
trust capital at that time.

Step 2. Work out the total of the * market values (at the time of
the disposal) of the * CGT assets that the trustee * acquired
before 20 September 1985 and that formed part of the
trust capital at that time.

Step 3. Work out the amount of money that formed part of the
trust capital at the time of the disposal.

Step 4. Add up the Step 1, 2 and 3 amounts.

Step 5. Subtract from the Step 4 amount any liabilities of the
trust at the time of the disposal.

Step 6. The result is the **_net asset amount_** .

Example: You dispose of your interest in the trust capital for $10,000 (the
capital proceeds).

The total of the cost bases of the CGT assets that the trustee acquired
on or after 20 September 1985 is $6,000.

The total of the market values of the CGT assets that the trustee
acquired before 20 September 1985 is $2,500.

There is $1,000 in the trust. The trust liabilities are $500.

The net asset amount is:

$6,000 + $2,500 + $1,000 –  $500  = $9,000

You make a capital gain of:

$10,000 –  $9,000 = $1,000

(3) If you * dispose of only _part_ of that interest, any * capital gain is
worked out using the method statement in subsection (1), except
that the Step 2 amount is replaced by:

(1) **_CGT event F3_** happens if a lessor incurs expenditure in getting the
lessee’s agreement to vary or waive a term of the lease. The lessor
makes a **_capital loss_** equal to the amount of expenditure it incurred.
(The expenditure can include giving property: see section 103-5.)

(2) The time of the event is when the term is varied or waived.

_Exception_

(3) However, this event does not apply to expenditure for a lease to
which the lessor has chosen to apply section 104-115.

##### 104-125  Lessee receives payment for changing lease: CGT event F4

(2) The time of the event is when the term is varied or waived.

(3) The lessee makes a **_capital gain_** if the * capital proceeds from the
event are _more_ than the lease’s * cost base (at the time of the event).
If the lessee makes a * capital gain, the lease’s cost base is also
reduced to nil.

Note: The lessee cannot make a capital loss.

(4) On the other hand, if those * capital proceeds are _less_ , the lease’s
* cost base is reduced by that amount at the time of the event.

Example: On 1 January 1999 a lessee enters a lease. On 1 May 1999 the lessee
agrees to waive a term. The lessor pays the lessee $1,000 for this.

##### Section 104-130

If the lease’s cost base at the time of the waiver is $2,500, it is reduced
from $2,500 to $1,500.

On 1 September 1999 the lessee agrees to waive another term. The
lessor pays the lessee $2,000 for this.

If the lease’s cost base at the time of the waiver is $1,500, the lessee
makes a capital gain of $500, and the cost base is reduced to nil.

(3) The lessor makes a **_capital gain_** if the * capital proceeds from the
event are _more_ than the expenditure the lessor incurs in relation to
the variation or waiver. The lessor makes a **_capital loss_** if those
capital proceeds are _less_ .

Example: You own a shopping centre. The lessee of a shop in the centre pays
you $10,000 for agreeing to change the terms of its lease. You incur
expenses of $1,000 for a solicitor and $500 for a valuer. You make a
capital gain of $8,500.

(4) The expenditure can include giving property: see section 103-5.
However, it does not include an amount you have received as
* recoupment of it and that is not included in your assessable

##### Section 104-155

(2) The time of the event is when the deposit is forfeited.

(3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the deposit is _more_ than the expenditure
you incur in connection with the prospective sale or other
transaction. You make a **_capital loss_** if the deposit is _less_ .

(4) The expenditure can include giving property: see section 103-5.
However, it does not include an amount you have received as
* recoupment of it and that is not included in your assessable
income.

Example: To continue the example: if you gave a lawyer wine worth $400 in
connection with the prospective sale, you make a capital gain of:

$1,000 – $400 $600 

##### 104-155  Receipt for event relating to a CGT asset: CGT event H2

(1) **_CGT event H2_** happens if:

(a) an act, transaction or event occurs in relation to a * CGT asset
that you own; and

(b) the act, transaction or event does not result in an adjustment
being made to the asset’s * cost base or * reduced cost base.

Example: You own land on which you intend to construct a manufacturing
facility. A business promotion organisation pays you $50,000 as an
inducement to start construction early.

No contractual rights or obligations are created by the arrangement.

The payment is made because of an event (the inducement to start
construction early) in relation to your land.

Note: This event does not apply if any other CGT event applies: see
section 102-25.

(2) The time of the event is when the act, transaction or event occurs.

(3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the * capital proceeds because of the
* CGT event are _more_ than the * incidental costs you incurred that
relate to the event. You make a **_capital loss_** if those capital
proceeds are _less_ .

##### Section 104-195

(2) **_CGT event J4_** also happens if:

(a) there is a roll-over under Subdivision 124-N for an entity (the
**_shareholding entity_** ) receiving a * share in a company in
exchange for a unit or interest in a trust under a trust
restructure; and

(b) the trust fails to cease to exist:

(i) within 6 months after the start of the * trust restructuring
period; or

(ii) if that is not possible because of circumstances outside
the control of the trustee—as soon as practicable after
the end of that 6 month period; and

(c) the shareholding entity owns the share when the failure
happens.

(3) The time of the event is when the failure to cease to exist happens.

(4) The company makes a **_capital gain_** if the * CGT asset’s * market
value at the time the company * acquired the asset is more than its
* cost base at that time. The company makes a **_capital loss_** if that
market value is less than the asset’s * reduced cost base at that time.

(5) This Part and Part 3-3 apply to the company from just after the
time of the event as if the first element of the * cost base and
* reduced cost base of the asset were its * market value at the time
the company * acquired the asset.

(6) The shareholding entity makes a **_capital gain_** if the * share’s
* market value at the time the entity * acquired the share is more
than its * cost base at that time. The shareholding entity makes a
**_capital loss_** if that market value is less than the share’s * reduced
cost base at that time.

(7) This Part and Part 3-3 apply to the shareholding entity from just
after the time of the event as if the first element of the * cost base
and * reduced cost base of the * share were its * market value at the
time the entity * acquired the share.

CGT events **Division 104**

##### Section 104-197

_Exception_

(8) This section does not apply to a * CGT asset acquired under a trust
restructure that happened before the day on which the _Taxation_
_Laws Amendment Act (No. 4) 2002_ received the Royal Assent.

##### 104-197  Failure to acquire replacement asset and to incur fourth
##### element expenditure after a roll-over under
##### Subdivision 152-E: CGT event J5

(1) **_CGT event J5_** happens if you choose a small business roll-over
under Subdivision 152-E for a * CGT event that happens in relation
to a * CGT asset in an income year and, by the end of the
* replacement asset period:

(a) you have not * acquired a replacement asset (the **_replacement_**
**_asset_** ), and have not incurred * fourth element expenditure in
relation to a CGT asset (also the **_replacement asset_** ); or

(b) the replacement asset does not satisfy the conditions set out
in subsection (2).

Note: You do not have to satisfy the basic conditions in Subdivision 152-A
for the gain in relation to CGT event J5 (see subsection 152-305(4)).

(2) The conditions are:

(a) the replacement asset must be your * active asset; and

(b) if the replacement asset is a * share in a company or an
interest in a trust:

(i) you, or an entity * connected with you, must be a * CGT
concession stakeholder in the company or trust; or

(ii) CGT concession stakeholders in the company or trust
must have a * small business participation percentage in
you of at least 90%.

Example: Joseph owns 50% of the shares in Company A and Company B. He is
therefore a CGT concession stakeholder in the companies: see
section 152-60. The companies are connected with Joseph (see
section 328-125) because he controls both of them.

Company A owns land which it leases to Joseph for use in a business.
It sells the land at a profit and buys shares in Company B.

##### 104-198  Cost of acquisition of replacement asset or amount of fourth
##### element expenditure, or both, not sufficient to cover
##### disregarded capital gain: CGT event J6

have a * small business participation percentage in you
of at least 90%; and

##### 104-210  Bankrupt pays amount in relation to debt: CGT event K2

(1) **_CGT event K2_** happens if:

(b) you make a payment in an income year (the **_payment year_** ) in
respect of a debt that was taken into account in working out
the amount of that net capital loss; and

(c) ignoring subsection 102-5(2), some part of the net capital

(4) In calculating that **_capital loss_** , disregard any amount you have
received as * recoupment of the payment and that is not included in
your assessable income.

Note 1: Paragraph 70-30(1)(a) allows you to elect the cost of the asset, or its
market value, just before it became trading stock.

Note 2: There is an exemption if you elect its cost: see section 118-25.

(2) The time of the event is when you start.

(3) You make a **_capital gain_** if the asset’s * market value (just before it

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 104** CGT events

##### Section 104-230

Note: The capital proceeds from that event are replaced with the market
value of the shares or the interest in the trust as if the fall in the market
value of collectables and personal use assets had not occurred: see
section 116-80.

(5) The time of CGT event K5 is the time of * CGT event A1, C2 or
E8.

(6) You make a **_capital loss_** from a * collectable equal to:

### - the * market value of the * shares or the interest in the trust
(worked out as at the time of * CGT event A1, C2 or E8 as
if the fall in market value of the collectable had not __
occurred);

less:

### - the actual * capital proceeds from CGT event A1, C2 or E8.

Example: You own 50% of the shares in a company. You bought them in 1999
for $60,000. The company owns a painting worth $100,000 and
another asset worth $20,000. The painting falls in value to $50,000.

In 1999 you sell your shares for $35,000 (the actual capital proceeds).
You would otherwise make a capital loss of $25,000.

However, the actual capital proceeds are replaced with $60,000 (the
market value of the shares if the painting had not fallen in value). You
do not make a capital loss from selling the shares.

You do make a collectable loss equal to:

$60,000 – $35,000 $25,000 

Note: You can subtract capital losses from collectables only from your
capital gains from collectables: see section 108-10.

##### 104-230  Pre-CGT shares or trust interest: CGT event K6

(1) **_CGT event K6_** happens if:

(a) you own * shares in a company or an interest in a trust you
* acquired _before_ 20 September 1985; and

(b)  * CGT event A1, C2, E1, E2, E3, E5, E6, E7, E8, J1 or K3
happens in relation to the shares or interest; and

(c) there is no roll-over for the other CGT event; and

(d) the applicable requirement in subsection (2) is satisfied.

(2) Just before the other event happened:

(a) the * market value of property of the company or trust (that is
not its * trading stock) that was * acquired on or after
20 September 1985; or

(b) the market value of interests the company or trust owned
through interposed companies or trusts in property (except
trading stock) that was * acquired on or after 20 September
1985;

must be at least 75% of the * net value of the company or trust.

(5) The time of CGT event K6 is when the other event happens.

(6) You make a * capital gain equal to that part of the * capital proceeds
from the * share or interest that is reasonably attributable to the
amount by which the * market value of the property referred to in
subsection (2) is _more_ than the sum of the * cost bases of that
property.

Note: You cannot make a capital loss.

(7) This section applies to property that a company that is a foreign
resident * acquired after 15 August 1989 from another company as
if it were acquired before 20 September 1985 if:

(a) the other company acquired it before 20 September 1985;
and

(b) the companies are members of the same * wholly-owned
group; and

(c) the property is not * taxable Australian property.

(8) In working out the * net value of a company or trust for the
purposes of subsection (2), disregard:

(a) the discharge or release of any liabilities; or

(b) the * market value of any * CGT assets acquired;

if the discharge or release, or the * acquisition, was done for a
purpose that included ensuring that the requirement in
subsection (2) would not be satisfied in a particular situation.

_Exceptions_

(9) **_CGT event K6_** does not happen if:

(a) for a company referred to in subsection (2)—some of its
* shares were listed for quotation in the official list of a stock
exchange in Australia or a foreign country at the time of the
other event and at all times in the period of 5 years before the
time of the other event; or

(b) for a trust referred to in subsection (2) that is a unit trust—
some of its units were so listed, or were ordinarily available
to the public for subscription or purchase, at the time of the
other event and at all times in that period.

(9A) Paragraph (9)(a) applies to a case where:

(a) the company referred to in subsection (2) is a * demerged
entity; and

(b)  * shares in the demerged entity do not satisfy the test referred
to in that paragraph; and

(c) the demerger happened not more than 5 years before the
other CGT event happened;

as if shares in the demerged entity were listed for quotation in the
official list of a stock exchange in Australia or a foreign country at
all times when some of the shares in the * head entity of the
* demerger group were so listed.

Example: Louise owns shares in a company which has been listed for 3 years.
The company is the head entity of a demerger group. As part of a
demerger, she receives new interests in a demerged entity. The
demerged entity then lists in its own right.

Since the head entity was listed for only 3 years, the demerged entity
must remain listed for 2 years before Louise’s new interests become
eligible for the exception from CGT event K6.

(9B) Paragraph (9)(b) applies to a case where:

##### Section 104-235

(a) the trust referred to in subsection (2) is a * demerged entity
and a unit trust; and

(b) units in the demerged entity do not satisfy the test referred to
in that paragraph; and

(c) the demerger happened not more than 5 years before the
other CGT event happened;

as if units in the demerged entity were listed for quotation in the
official list of a stock exchange in Australia or a foreign country, or
were ordinarily available to the public for subscription or purchase,
at all times when some of the units in the * head entity of the
* demerger group were so listed or available.

(10) A * capital gain is disregarded for a * share in a company or an
interest in a trust to the extent that, had you * acquired it on or after
20 September 1985, you could have chosen a roll-over for the other
* CGT event under Subdivision 124-M (scrip for scrip roll-over).

Example: Bill owns a unit in a trust that he acquired before 20 September 1985.
He exchanges the unit for a unit in another trust worth $60 and $40
cash. He makes a capital gain of $50 because of CGT event K6.

Had the unit been acquired after 20 September 1985, Bill would have
been entitled to a partial roll-over of the capital gain under
Subdivision 124-M to the extent that his capital proceeds constituted a
replacement unit.

Bill can therefore disregard 60 / 100 of the $50 gain ($30). The cost base
of Bill’s replacement unit is reduced by this amount. Bill must include
the remaining $20 of the CGT event K6 gain in the calculation of his
net capital gain or loss for the year.

Note: A capital gain or loss made by a demerging entity from CGT event K6
happening as a result of a demerger is also disregarded: see
section 125-155.

##### 104-235  Balancing adjustment events for depreciating assets and

(3) You work out whether you have a **_net overstated amount_** or **_net_**
**_understated amount_** using this table:

**Meaning of** **_net overstated amount_** **and** **_net understated amount_**

**Item** **In this situation:** **There is this result:**

There is a **_net overstated_**
**_amount_** . It is the overstated
amount, or the sum of the
overstated amounts.

1 There are one or more overstated amounts
under section 705-315 for the * subsidiary
member but no understated amount under
that section for the subsidiary member

There is a **_net understated_**
**_amount_** . It is the understated
amount, or the sum of the
understated amounts.

2 There are one or more understated
amounts under section 705-315 for the
* subsidiary member but no overstated
amount under that section for the
subsidiary member

There is a **_net overstated_**
**_amount_** . It is the difference
between those sums

3 There are both one or more overstated
amounts and one or more understated
amounts under section 705-315 for the
* subsidiary member and the sum of the
overstated amounts exceeds the sum of the
understated amounts

There is a **_net understated_**
**_amount_** . It is the difference
between those sums

4 There are both one or more overstated
amounts and one or more understated
amounts under section 705-315 for the
* subsidiary member and the sum of the
overstated amounts is less than the sum of
the understated amounts

(4) If the time when the Commissioner becomes aware of the errors is
within the period within which the Commissioner may amend all
of the assessments necessary to correct the errors, then, for the
head company core purposes mentioned in subsection 701-1(2):

(a) if you have a * net overstated amount—you make a **_capital_**
**_gain_** equal to that amount; or

(b) if you have a * net understated amount—you make a **_capital_**
**_loss_** equal to that amount.

(5) If the time when the Commissioner becomes aware of the errors is
not within that period, then, for the head company core purposes
mentioned in subsection 701-1(2):

(a) if you have a * net overstated amount—you make a **_capital_**
**_gain_** of the amount worked out under subsection (6); or

(b) if you have a * net understated amount—you make a **_capital_**
**_loss_** of the amount worked out under subsection (6).

(6) The amount of the * capital gain or * capital loss is worked out as
follows:

Current asset setting amount
Stated amount
Original asset setting amount


where:

**_current asset setting amount_** means the * tax cost setting amount
for all assets referred to in subsection 705-315(2) as reset cost base
assets that the * head company of the * consolidated group or the
* MEC group held continuously from the time when the * subsidiary
member joined the group until the start of the head company’s
income year that is the earliest income year for which the
Commissioner could amend the head company’s assessment to
correct any of the errors.

**_original asset setting amount_** means the * tax cost setting amount
for all assets referred to in subsection 705-315(2) as reset cost base
assets that the * subsidiary member held at the time it joined the
group.

**_stated amount_** means the * net overstated amount or the * net
understated amount, as the case requires.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Entity making the gain or loss **Division 106**

##### Section 106-5

Each partner’s gain or loss is calculated by reference to the
partnership agreement, or partnership law if there is no agreement.

Example 1: A partnership creates contractual rights in another entity (CGT event
D1). Each partner’s capital gain or loss is calculated by allocating an
appropriate share of the capital proceeds from the event and the
incidental costs that relate to the event (according to the partnership
agreement, or partnership law if there is no agreement).

Example 2: Helen and Clare set up a business in partnership. Helen contributes a
block of land to the partnership capital. Their partnership agreement
recognises that Helen has a 75% interest in the land and Clare 25%.
The agreement is silent as to their interests in other assets and profit
sharing.

When the land is sold, Helen’s capital gain or loss will be
determined on the basis of her 75% interest. For other partnership
assets, Helen’s gain or loss will be determined on the basis of her
50% interest (under the relevant Partnership Act).

(2) Each partner has a separate * cost base and * reduced cost base for
the partner’s interest in each * CGT asset of the partnership.

(3) If a partner leaves a partnership, a remaining partner * acquires a
separate * CGT asset to the extent that the remaining partner
acquires a share of the departing partner’s interest in a partnership
asset.

Note: The remaining partners would not be affected if the departing partner
sells its interests to an entity that was not a partner.

Example: (Indexation is ignored for the purpose of this example).

John, Wil and Patricia form a partnership (in equal shares).

John contributes a building (which is a pre-20 September 1985 asset)
having a market value of $200,000. Wil and Patricia contribute
$200,000 each in cash.

The partnership buys another asset for $400,000.

John is taken to have disposed of 2 / 3 of his interest in the building ( 1 / 3
to Wil and 1 / 3 to Patricia). His remaining 1 / 3 share in the building
remains a pre-CGT asset. The 1 / 3 shares that Wil and Patricia acquire
are post-CGT assets.

Wil retires from the partnership when the partnership assets have a
market value of $1,200,000 ($500,000 for the building and $700,000

for the other asset). John and Patricia pay Wil $400,000 for his interest
in the partnership.

Wil has a capital gain of $100,000 on the building and $100,000 on
the other asset. John and Patricia each acquire an additional 1 / 6 interest
in the partnership assets. These additional interests are separate assets
and post-CGT assets.

(4) If a new partner is admitted to a partnership:

(a) the new partner * acquires a share (according to the
partnership agreement, or partnership law if there is no
agreement) of each partnership asset; and

(b) the existing partners are treated as having * disposed of part of
their interest in each partnership asset to the extent that the
new partner has acquired it.

Example: (Indexation is ignored for the purpose of this example).

Lyn and Barry form a partnership, each contributing $15,000 to its
capital. The partnership buys land for $30,000.

The land increases in value to $300,000.

Andrew is admitted as an equal partner, paying Lyn and Barry
$50,000 each to acquire a 1 / 3 share in the land. His cost base is
$100,000.

Lyn and Barry have each disposed of 1 / 3 of their interest in the land.
Each has a cost base for that interest of $5,000, and capital proceeds
of $50,000, leaving them with a capital gain of $45,000 each on
Andrew’s admission to the partnership.

The land is sold for its market value.

Andrew has no capital gain on the land.

Lyn and Barry have disposed of their remaining 2 / 3 original interest in
the land for capital proceeds of $100,000, leaving each of them with a
capital gain of:

#### Subdivision 106-B—Bankruptcy and liquidation

##### Table of sections

106-30 Effect of bankruptcy

106-35 Effect of liquidation

##### 106-30  Effect of bankruptcy

(1) For the purposes of this Part and Part 3-3 (about capital gains and
losses) and Subdivision 328-C (What is a small business entity),
the vesting of the individual’s * CGT assets in the trustee under the
_Bankruptcy Act 1966_ or under a similar foreign law is ignored.

(2) This Part, Part 3-3 and Subdivision 328-C apply to an act done in
relation to a * CGT asset of an individual in these circumstances as
if the act had been done by the individual (instead of by the trustee
etc.):

(a) as a result of the bankruptcy of the individual by the Official
Trustee in Bankruptcy or a registered trustee, or the holder of
a similar office under a * foreign law;

(b) by a trustee under a personal insolvency agreement made
under Part X of the _Bankruptcy Act 1966_ , or under a similar
instrument under a foreign law;

(c) by a trustee as a result of an arrangement with creditors under
that Act or a foreign law.

Example: A CGT asset of an individual vests in a trustee because of the
bankruptcy of the individual. No CGT event happens as a result of the
vesting.

The trustee later sells the CGT asset. Any capital gain or loss is made
by the individual, not the trustee.

##### 106-35  Effect of liquidation

(1) For the purposes of this Part and Part 3-3 (about capital gains and
losses) and Subdivision 328-C (What is a small business entity),
the vesting of a company’s * CGT assets in a liquidator, or the

liquidator of a company, or the holder of a similar office under a
* foreign law, as if the act had been done by the company (instead
of by the liquidator etc.).

Example: Ben, a liquidator of a company, sells a CGT asset of the company.
Any capital gain or loss is made by the company, not by Ben.

(1) For the purposes of this Part and Part 3-3 (about capital gains and
losses) and Subdivision 328-C (What is a small business entity),
from just after the time you become absolutely entitled to a * CGT
asset as against the trustee of a trust (disregarding any legal
disability), the asset is treated as being your asset (instead of being
an asset of the trust).

(2) This Part, Part 3-3 and Subdivision 328-C apply, from just after the
time you become absolutely entitled to a * CGT asset as against the
trustee of a trust (disregarding any legal disability), to an act done
in relation to the asset by the trustee as if the act had been done by
you (instead of by the trustee).

Example: An individual becomes absolutely entitled to a CGT asset of a trust.
The trustee later sells the asset. Any capital gain or loss from the sale
is made by the individual, not the trustee.

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Entity making the gain or loss **Division 106**

##### Section 106-60

##### 106-60  Securities, charges and encumbrances

(1) For the purposes of this Part and Part 3-3 (about capital gains and
losses) and Subdivision 328-C (What is a small business entity):

(a) the vesting of a * CGT asset in an entity is ignored, if:

(i) the vesting is for the purpose of enforcing, giving effect
to or maintaining a security, charge or encumbrance
over the asset; and

(ii) the security, charge or encumbrance remains over the
asset just after the vesting; and

(b) a CGT asset is treated as vesting in an entity at the time a
security, charge or encumbrance ceases to be over the asset,
if:

(i) the entity holds the asset just after that time because the
asset vested in the entity at an earlier time; and

(ii) that earlier vesting was ignored under paragraph (a)
because it was for the purpose of enforcing, giving
effect to or maintaining the security, charge or
encumbrance.

(2) This Part, Part 3-3 and Subdivision 328-C apply to an act done by
an entity (or an * agent of the entity) in relation to a * CGT asset for
the purpose of enforcing, giving effect to or maintaining a security,
charge or encumbrance over the asset as if the act had been done
by the entity that provided the security (instead of by the
first-mentioned entity or its agent).

Example: A CGT asset of a borrower vests in a lender as security for a loan. No
CGT event happens as a result of the vesting.

If the borrower fails to make payments on the loan and the lender sells
the CGT asset under the security arrangement, any capital gain or loss
is made by the borrower, not the lender.

(b) a legal or equitable right that is not property.

(2) To avoid doubt, these are **_CGT assets_** :

(a) part of, or an interest in, an asset referred to in subsection (1);

(b) goodwill or an interest in it;

(c) an interest in an asset of a partnership;

(d) an interest in a partnership that is not covered by

Note 1: Examples of CGT assets are:
- land and buildings;

- shares in a company and units in a unit trust;

- options;

- debts owed to you;

- a right to enforce a contractual obligation;

- foreign currency.

Note 2: An asset is not a CGT asset if the asset was last acquired before

_Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ .

##### 108-7  Interest in CGT assets as joint tenants

Individuals who own a * CGT asset as joint tenants are treated as if

**Division 108** CGT assets

##### Section 108-10

##### 108-10  Losses from collectables to be offset only against gains from
##### collectables

(1) In working out your * net capital gain or * net capital loss for the
income year, * capital losses from * collectables can be used only to
reduce * capital gains from collectables.

Note: You choose the order in which you reduce your capital gains from
collectables by your capital losses from collectables.

Example: Your capital gains from collectables total $200 and your capital losses
from collectables total $400. You have other capital gains of $500.
You have a net capital gain of $500 and a net capital loss from
collectables of $200.

The losses from collectables cannot be used to reduce the $500 capital
gain.

(2) A **_collectable_** is:

(a)  * artwork, jewellery, an antique, or a coin or medallion; or

(b) a rare folio, manuscript or book; or

(c) a postage stamp or first day cover;

that is used or kept mainly for your (or your * associate’s) personal
use or enjoyment.

(3) These are also **_collectables_** :

(a) an interest in any of the things covered by subsection (2); or

(b) a debt that arises from any of those things; or

(c) an option or right to * acquire any of those things.

Note: Collectables acquired for $500 or less are exempt. However, you get
an exemption for an interest in one only if the market value of all the
interests combined is $500 or less: see Subdivision 118-A.

(4) If some or all of a * capital loss from a * collectable cannot be
applied in an income year, the unapplied amount can be applied in
the next income year for which your * capital gains from
* collectables exceed your * capital losses (if any) from collectables.

Example: You have a capital gain from a collectable for the income year of $200
and a capital loss from another collectable of $600.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

CGT assets **Division 108**

##### Section 108-15

Your capital loss from one collectable reduces your capital gain from
the other to zero. You cannot apply the remaining $400 of the capital
loss in this income year, but you can apply it in a later income year.

(5) If you have 2 or more unapplied * net capital losses from
* collectables, you must apply them in the order you made them.

##### 108-15  Sets of collectables

(1) This section sets out what happens if:

(a) you own * collectables that are a set; and

(b) they would ordinarily be * disposed of as a set; and

(c) you dispose of them in one or more transactions for the
purpose of trying to obtain the exemption in section 118-10.

Example: You buy a set of 3 books for $900. You apportion the $900 among
each book: see section 112-30. If the books are of equal value, you
have acquired each one for $300.

If you dispose of each book individually, you would ordinarily obtain
the exemption in section 118-10, because you acquired each one for
less than $500.

(2) The set of * collectables is taken to be a single * collectable and each
of your * disposals is a disposal of part of that collectable.

Example: To continue the example, the 3 books are taken to be a single
collectable. You will not obtain the exemption in section 118-10,
because you acquired the set for more than $500.

You work out if you make a capital gain or loss from a disposal of
part of an asset by comparing the capital proceeds from it with the
cost base or reduced cost base (as appropriate) of the disposed part.

Note 1: Section 112-30 tells you how to apportion the cost base and reduced
cost base of a CGT asset on a disposal of part of an asset.

Note 2: This section does not apply to a collectable you last acquired before
16 December 1995: see section 108-15 of the _Income Tax_
_(Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ .

##### 108-17  Cost base of a collectable

In working out the * cost base of a * collectable, disregard the third
element (about costs of ownership).

(a) a * CGT asset (except a * collectable) that is used or kept
mainly for your (or your * associate’s) personal use or
enjoyment; or

(b) an option or right to * acquire a * CGT asset of that kind; or

(c) a debt arising from a * CGT event in which the * CGT asset

(ii) from your carrying on a * business.

Note 1: There is an exemption for a personal use asset you acquire for $10,000
or less: see section 118-10.

Note 2: A debt arising from a CGT event involving a CGT asset kept mainly
for your personal use and enjoyment is a personal use asset to prevent
any loss arising from the debt being a normal capital loss.

(3) A **_personal use asset_** does _not_ include land, a * stratum unit or a
building or structure that is taken to be a separate * CGT asset
because of Subdivision 108-D.

##### Section 108-30

(a) you own * personal use assets that are a set; and

(b) they would ordinarily be * disposed of as a set; and

(c) you dispose of them in one or more transactions for the
purpose of trying to obtain the exemption in section 118-10.

(2) The set of * personal use assets is taken to be a single * personal use
asset and each of your * disposals is a disposal of part of that asset.

In working out the * cost base of a * personal use asset, disregard the
third element (about the costs of ownership).

#### Subdivision 108-D—Separate CGT assets

#### Guide to Subdivision 108-D

##### 108-50  What this Subdivision is about

For CGT purposes, there are:

## - exceptions to the common law principle that what is attached
to the land is part of the land; and

## - special rules about buildings and adjacent land; and

## - rules about when a capital improvement to a CGT asset is
treated as a separate CGT asset.

Note: In addition to the circumstances set out in this Subdivision, separate
asset treatment can apply under section 124-595 (about a roll-over for
a Crown lease) and section 124-725 (about a roll-over for a
prospecting or mining entitlement).

#### Operative provisions

##### 108-55  When is a building a separate asset from land?

(1) A building or structure on land that you * acquired _on or after_ 
20 September 1985 is taken to be a separate * CGT asset from the
land if one of these balancing adjustment provisions applies to the
building or structure (whether or not there is a balancing
adjustment):

(a) Subdivision 40-D; or

(b) section 355-315 or 355-525 (about R&D).

Example: You construct a timber mill building on land you own. The building is
subject to a balancing adjustment on its disposal, loss or destruction. It
is taken to be a separate CGT asset from the land.

(2) A building or structure that is constructed on land that you
* acquired _before_ 20 September 1985 is taken to be a separate * CGT
asset from the land if:

(a) you entered into a contract for the construction on or after
that day; or

(b) if there is no contract—the construction started on or after
that day.

Example: You bought a block of land with a building on it on 10 August 1984.
On 1 December 1999 you construct another building on the land. The
other building is taken to be a separate CGT asset from the land.

##### 108-60  Depreciating asset that is part of a building is a separate
##### asset

A * depreciating asset that is part of a building or structure is taken
to be a separate * CGT asset from the building or structure.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

CGT assets **Division 108**

##### Section 108-65

Example: You own a factory from which you carry on a business. You install
rest rooms for your employees. The plumbing fixtures and fittings are
depreciating assets. These are taken to be a separate CGT asset from
the factory.

##### 108-65  Land adjacent to land acquired before 20 September 1985

Land that you * acquire on or after 20 September 1985 that is
adjacent to land (the **_original land_** ) you acquired before that day is
taken to be a separate * CGT asset from the original land if it and
the original land are amalgamated into one title.

Example: On 1 April 1984 you bought a block of land. On 1 June 1999 you
bought another block of land adjacent to the first block. You
amalgamate the titles to the 2 blocks into 1 title.

The second block is treated as a separate CGT asset. You can make a
capital gain or loss from it if you sell the whole area of land.

##### 108-70  When is a capital improvement a separate asset?

_Improvements to land_

(1) A capital improvement to land is taken to be a separate * CGT asset
from the land if one of the balancing adjustment provisions set out
in subsection 108-55(1) applies to the improvement (whether or
not there is a balancing adjustment).

Example: You own land that you use for pastoral operations. You build some
fences that are destroyed by fire. The fences are depreciating assets
and are subject to a balancing adjustment on their destruction under
Division 40. The fences are taken to be a separate CGT asset from the
land.

_Unrelated improvements to pre-CGT assets_

(2) A capital improvement to a * CGT asset (the **_original asset_** ) that
you * acquired _before_ 20 September 1985 (that is not related to any
other capital improvement to the asset) is taken to be a separate
* CGT asset if its * cost base (assuming it were a separate CGT
asset) when a CGT event happens (except one that happens
because of your death) in relation to the original asset is:

**Division 108** CGT assets

##### Section 108-70

(a) more than the * improvement threshold for the income year in
which the event happened; and

(b) more than 5% of the * capital proceeds from the event.

Example: In 1983 you bought a boat. In 1999 you install a new mast (a capital
improvement) for $30,000. Later, you sell the boat for $150,000.

If the cost base of the improvement in the sale year is $41,000 and the
improvement threshold for that year is $96,000, the improvement will
not be treated as a separate asset.

Note 1: Section 108-80 sets out the factors for deciding whether capital
improvements are related to each other.

Note 2: If the improvement is a separate asset, the capital proceeds from the
event must be apportioned between the original asset and the
improvement: see section 116-40.

_Related improvements to pre-CGT assets_

(3) Capital improvements to a * CGT asset (the **_original asset_** ) that you
* acquired _before_ 20 September 1985 that are related to each other
are taken to be a separate * CGT asset if the total of their * cost bases
(assuming each one were a separate CGT asset) when a * CGT
event happens in relation to the original asset is:

(a) more than the * improvement threshold for the income year in
which the event happened; and

(b) more than 5% of the * capital proceeds from the event.

Note: If the improvements are a separate asset, the capital proceeds from the
event must be apportioned between the original asset and the
improvements: see section 116-40.

_Some improvements not relevant_

(4) This section does not apply to a capital improvement:

(a) that took place under a contract that you entered into before
20 September 1985; or

(b) if there is no contract—that started or occurred before that
day.

(5) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the capital improvement is
made to:

(a) a * Crown lease; or

(b) a * prospecting entitlement or * mining entitlement; or

(c) a * statutory licence; or

(d) a * depreciating asset to which Subdivision 124-K applies.

Note: Section 108-75 deals with this situation.

(6) This section does not apply to a capital improvement consisting of
repairs to or restoration of a * CGT asset * acquired before
20 September 1985 in circumstances where there is a roll-over
under Subdivision 124-B.

##### 108-75  Capital improvements to CGT assets for which a roll-over
##### may be available

(1) This section is relevant only if a * CGT event happens in relation to
a * CGT asset that is:

(a) a * Crown lease; or

(b) a * prospecting entitlement or * mining entitlement; or

(c) a * statutory licence; or

(d) a * depreciating asset to which Subdivision 124-K applies.

You must have * acquired it before 20 September 1985.

Note: Division 124 treats you as having acquired a CGT asset before that
day in some situations.

(2) There are possible consequences if there has been one or more
capital improvements to:

(a) the * CGT asset the subject of the * CGT event; or

(b) any * CGT assets of the same kind that were in existence
before the CGT asset and came to an end where a roll-over
was obtained under a provision set out in this table:

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 108** CGT assets

##### Section 108-75

**Roll-over provisions**

**Item** **For this CGT asset:**

**Roll-over is obtained under this**
**provision:**

1 A * Crown lease Subdivision 124-J

Subdivision 124-L

2 A prospecting or mining
entitlement

3 A * statutory licence Subdivision 124-C or former
Subdivision 124-O

4 A * depreciating asset Subdivision 124-K

Note: Roll-overs under former sections 160ZWA, 160ZZF, 160ZZPE and
160ZWC of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ are also relevant:
see section 108-75 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act_
_1997_ .

Example: In 1984 you acquired a commercial fishing licence. In 1986 you paid
$62,000 to get an extra right (a capital improvement) attached to the
licence.

In June 1999 the licence expired and you got a new licence. You
obtained a roll-over for the old licence expiring. In April 2000 you
sold the new fishing licence for $200,000.

(3) Any capital improvement that is not related to another capital
improvement is taken to be a separate * CGT asset if its * cost base
(assuming it were a separate CGT asset) when the * CGT event
happens is:

(a) more than the * improvement threshold for the income year in
which the event happened; and

(b) more than 5% of the * capital proceeds from the event.

Example: To continue the example, suppose the cost base of the right is
$101,000 and the improvement threshold for the 1999-2000 income
year is $96,000.

Since the cost base of the right is more than the improvement
threshold and more than 5% of the capital proceeds, the right is taken
to be a separate CGT asset.

Note 1: Section 108-80 sets out the factors for deciding whether capital
improvements are related to each other.

commercial or practical sense on another improvement; and

(d) whether the improvements are part of an overall project; and

(e) whether the improvements are of the same kind; and

(f) whether the improvements are made within a reasonable

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Cost base and reduced cost base **Division 110**

##### Section 110-25

##### 110-25  General rules about **_cost base_**

(1) The **_cost base_** of a * CGT asset consists of 5 elements.

Note 1: You need to keep records of each element: see Division 121.

Note 2: The cost base is reduced by net input tax credits: see section 103-30.

Note 3: An amount that makes up all or part of an element of the cost base of
an asset may be determined under section 230-505, if the amount is
provided for acquiring a thing, and you start or cease to have a
Division 230 financial arrangement as consideration for the
acquisition of the thing.

_5 elements of the cost base_

(2) The first element is the total of:

(a) the money you paid, or are required to pay, in respect of
* acquiring it; and

(b) the * market value of any other property you gave, or are
required to give, in respect of acquiring it (worked out as at
the time of the acquisition).

Note 1: There are special rules for working out when you are required to pay
money or give other property: see section 103-15.

Note 2: This element is replaced with another amount in many situations: see
Division 112.

(3) The second element is the * incidental costs you incurred. These
costs can include giving property: see section 103-5.

Note: There is one situation to do with options in which the incidental costs
relating to the CGT event are modified: see section 112-85.

(4) The third element is the costs of owning the * CGT asset you
incurred (but only if you * acquired the asset after 20 August 1991).
These costs include:

(a) interest on money you borrowed to acquire the asset; and

(b) costs of maintaining, repairing or insuring it; and

(c) rates or land tax, if the asset is land; and

(d) interest on money you borrowed to refinance the money you
borrowed to acquire the asset; and

##### Section 110-25

(e) interest on money you borrowed to finance the capital
expenditure you incurred to increase the asset’s value.

These costs can include giving property: see section 103-5.

Note: This element does not apply to personal use assets or collectables: see
sections 108-17 and 108-30.

(5) The fourth element is capital expenditure you incurred:

(a) the purpose or the expected effect of which is to increase or
preserve the asset’s value; or

(b) that relates to installing or moving the asset.

The expenditure can include giving property: see section 103-5.

Note: There are 3 situations involving leases in which this element is
modified: see section 112-80.

(5A) Subsection (5) does not apply to capital expenditure incurred in
relation to goodwill.

(6) The fifth element is capital expenditure that you incurred to
establish, preserve or defend your title to the asset, or a right over
the asset. (The expenditure can include giving property: see
section 103-5.)

_Assume a CGT event for purposes of working out cost base at a_
_particular time_

(12) If:

(a) it is necessary to work out the * cost base at a particular time;
and

(b) a * CGT event does not happen in relation to the asset at or
just after that time;

assume, for the purpose only of working out the cost base at the
particular time, that such an event does happen in relation to the
asset at or just after that time.

Note 1: For example, in order to apply subsection 110-37(1), it is necessary
for there to be a CGT event.

Note 2: The assumption that a CGT event happens does not have any
consequence beyond that stated. For example, it does _not_ mean that

(2) The _first_ is remuneration for the services of a surveyor, valuer,
auctioneer, accountant, broker, * agent, consultant or legal adviser.
However, remuneration for professional advice about the operation

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 110** Cost base and reduced cost base

##### Section 110-36

(10) The _ninth_ is expenditure that:

(a) is incurred by the * head company of a * consolidated group or
* MEC group to an entity that is not a * member of the group;
and

(b) reasonably relates to a * CGT asset * held by the head
company; and

(c) is incurred because of a transaction that is between members
of the group.

Example: Land is transferred by one company to another company. The
companies are members of a consolidated group. Stamp duty is
payable as a result of the transaction.

The transaction has no taxation consequences because of its
intra-group nature.

The stamp duty is included in the cost base and reduced cost base of
the land.

Note: Intra-group assets are not held by the head company because of the
operation of subsection 701-1(1) (the single entity rule). An example
of an intra-group asset is a debt owed by a member of the consolidated
group to another member of the group.

(11) The _tenth_ is termination or other similar fees incurred as a direct
result of your ownership of a * CGT asset ending.

##### 110-36  Indexation

(1) The **_cost base_** of a * CGT asset * acquired at or before 11.45 am (by
legal time in the Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September
1999 also includes indexation of the elements of the cost base
(except the third element) if the requirements of Division 114 are
met.

(2) However, for the purposes of working out the * capital gain of an
entity mentioned in an item of the table from a * CGT event
happening after 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital
Territory) on 21 September 1999, the **_cost base_** includes indexation
only if the entity mentioned in the item chooses that the cost base
includes indexation.

##### Section 110-37

**Choice of indexation**

**Item** **For the purposes of working out**
**the capital gain of this entity:**

**The cost base includes indexation**
**only if this entity chooses so:**

1 An individual The individual

2 A * complying superannuation entity The trustee of the complying
superannuation entity

3 A trust The trustee of the trust

4 A listed investment company The company

Note 1: Section 103-25 specifies when you must make the choice and provides
that the way you prepare your income tax return is evidence of your
choice.

Note 2: For each CGT asset whose cost base you need to work out, you may
either choose to index the expenditure included in the asset’s cost base
or not make that choice. If you do not choose to index the expenditure,
your net capital gain includes only part of your capital gain on the
CGT asset as worked out on the basis of the cost base not including
indexation and reduced by your capital losses.

(3) Also, for the purpose of working out the * capital gain of a * life
insurance company from a * CGT event happening after 30 June
2000 in respect of a * CGT asset that is a * complying
superannuation asset, the **_cost base_** includes indexation only if the
life insurance company chooses that the cost base includes
indexation.

Note: Section 110-25 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_
provides that, in working out the capital gain from a CGT event after
11.45 am on 21 September 1999 and before 1 July 2000 in respect of
an asset of a life insurance company or registered organisation, the
cost base includes indexation only if the company or organisation
chooses it.

#### What does **_not_** **form part of the cost base**

##### 110-37  Expenditure forming part of cost base or element

(1) If a later provision of this Subdivision says that:

(a) certain expenditure does not form part of the * cost base of a
* CGT asset; or

(b) the cost base is reduced by certain expenditure;

the expenditure is initially included in the cost base, which is then
reduced by the amount of the expenditure just before a * CGT event
happens in relation to the asset.

Note: This has the effect of recognising in the cost base any indexed
component relating to the expenditure.

(2) On the other hand, if such a provision says that:

(a) certain expenditure does not form part of one or more
_elements_ of the * cost base of a * CGT asset; or

(b) one or more _elements_ of the cost base are reduced by certain
expenditure;

the expenditure is never included in the relevant elements of the
cost base.

Note: This has the effect of _not_ recognising to any extent this expenditure in
the cost base.

##### 110-38  Exclusions

(1) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to
the extent that section 26-54 prevents it being deducted (even if
some other provision also prevents it being deducted).

Note: Section 26-54 prevents deductions for expenditure related to certain
offences.

(2) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to
the extent that it is a * bribe to a foreign public official or a * bribe to
a public official.

(3) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to
the extent that it is in respect of providing * entertainment.

(4) Expenditure does _not_ form part of any element of the **_cost base_** to
the extent that section 26-5 prevents it being deducted (even if
some other provision also prevents it being deducted).

Note: Section 26-5 denies deductions for penalties.

subparagraphs applies:

(i) if Division 58 does not apply to the asset—any amount
included in the assessable income of the partnership for
any income year because of a balancing adjustment for
the asset;

(ii) if Division 58 applies to the asset and an amount has
been included in the assessable income of the
partnership for an income year because of a balancing
adjustment for the asset—any part of that amount that
was attributable to amounts that the partnership has
deducted or can deduct for depreciation of the asset; and

(b) any amount that would have been so included apart from any
of these (which provide relief from including a balancing
charge in your assessable income):

#### Guide to Division 112

##### 112-1  What this Division is about

This Division tells you the situations that may modify the general
rules about the cost base and reduced cost base of a CGT asset.

##### 112-5  Discussion of modifications

(1) Modifications can occur from the time you acquired the CGT asset
to when a CGT event happens in relation to it.

Note: You should keep records of the modifications: see Division 121.

(2) Most modifications replace the first element (what you paid for a
CGT asset) of the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset.

(3) Subdivision 112-A contains operative provisions setting out the
general situations that may result in a modification to the general
rules.

(4) Subdivision 112-B (which is a guide) has a number of tables (each
one covering a specialist topic) that tell you each situation that _may_ 
result in a modification to the general rules.

or reduced cost base.

(6) Subdivision 112-D (which is a guide) explains what a _same-asset_ 
roll-over is and how it can modify the cost base or reduced cost
base.

(7) Section 230-505 provides special rules for working out the amount
of consideration for an asset if the asset is a * Division 230 financial
arrangement or a Division 230 financial arrangement is involved in
that consideration.

##### 112-15  General rule for replacement modifications

If a cost base modification replaces an element of the * cost base of
a * CGT asset with an amount, this Part and Part 3-3 apply to you as
if you had paid that amount.

Example: An individual pays $10,000 to acquire an option. The individual dies
and the option devolves to his legal personal representative, who
exercises the option.

Section 134-1 applies to the legal personal representative as if the
representative had paid $10,000 for the option.

**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 112** Modifications to cost base and reduced cost base

##### Section 112-20

##### 112-20  Market value substitution rule

(1) The first element of your * cost base and * reduced cost base of a
* CGT asset you * acquire from another entity is its * market value
(at the time of acquisition) if:

(a) you did not incur expenditure to acquire it, except where
your acquisition of the asset resulted from:

(i)  * CGT event D1 happening; or

(ii) another entity doing something that did not constitute a
CGT event happening; or

(b) some or all of the expenditure you incurred to acquire it
cannot be valued; or

(c) you did not deal at * arm’s length with the other entity in
connection with the acquisition.

The expenditure can include giving property: see section 103-5.

(2) Despite paragraph (1)(c), if:

(a) you did not deal at * arm’s length with the other entity; and

(b) your * acquisition of the * CGT asset resulted from another
entity doing something that did not constitute a CGT event
happening;

the * market value is substituted only if what you paid to acquire the
CGT asset was more than its market value (at the time of
acquisition).
The payment can include giving property: see section 103-5.

(3) There are some situations in which the rule in subsection (1) does
not apply. They include the situations set out in this table:

**Exceptions to the market value substitution rule**

**Item** **You** ***** **acquired this CGT asset:** **...in this situation:**

(a) you did not pay or give
anything for the right; and

1 A right to receive * ordinary income or
* statutory income from a trust (except a
unit trust or a trust that arises because
of someone’s death)

(b) you did not acquire the right
by way of an assignment from
another entity

**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 112** Modifications to cost base and reduced cost base

##### Section 112-25

(a) a * CGT asset (the **_original asset_** ) is split into 2 or more assets
(the **_new assets_** ); or

(b) a * CGT asset (also the **_original asset_** ) changes in whole or in
part into an asset (also the **_new asset_** ) of a different nature;

and you are the beneficial owner of the original asset and each new
asset.

Example: You subdivide a block of land into 3 separate blocks. Each of those
blocks is a _new asset_ .

(2) The splitting or change is not a * CGT event.

(3) You work out the * cost base and * reduced cost base of each new
asset as follows:

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out each element of the * cost base and * reduced
cost base of the original asset at the time of the event
referred to in subsection (1).

Step 2. Apportion in a reasonable way each element to each new
asset. The result is each corresponding element of the
new asset’s * cost base and * reduced cost base.

_Merged assets_

(4) If 2 or more * CGT assets (the **_original assets_** ) are merged into a
single asset (the **_new asset_** ) and you are the beneficial owner of the
original assets and the new asset:

(a) the merger is not a * CGT event; and

(b) each element of the * cost base and * reduced cost base of the
new asset (at the time of the merging) is the sum of the
corresponding elements of each original asset.

Modifications to cost base and reduced cost base **Division 112**

##### Section 112-30

##### 112-30  Apportionment rules

_Apportionment on acquisition of an asset_

(1) If you * acquire a * CGT asset because of a transaction and only part
of the expenditure you incurred under the transaction relates to the
acquisition of the asset, the first element of your * cost base and
* reduced cost base of the asset is that part of the expenditure that is
reasonably attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

The expenditure can include giving property: see section 103-5.

_Apportionment of expenditure in other elements_

(1A) If you incur expenditure and only part of it relates to another
element of the * cost base or * reduced cost base of a * CGT asset,
that element includes that part of the expenditure that is reasonably
attributable to that element.

_Apportionment for CGT asset that was part of another asset_

(2) The * cost base and * reduced cost base of a * CGT asset is
apportioned if a * CGT event happens to some part of the asset, but
not to the remainder of it.

Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 104-5.

(3) The * cost base for the * CGT asset representing the part to which
the * CGT event happened is worked out using the formula:

Capital proceeds for the CGT event



happening to the part
Cost base of the asset
Those capital proceeds plus the market

value of the remainder of the asset

The * reduced cost base is worked out similarly.

(4) The remainder of the * cost base and * reduced cost base of the asset
is attributed to the part that remains.

**Division 112** Modifications to cost base and reduced cost base

##### Section 112-35

Example: You acquire a truck for $24,000 and sell its motor for $9,000. Suppose
the market value of the remainder of the truck is $16,000.

Under subsection (3), the cost base of the motor is:

$9,000
$24,000 $8,640
$9,000 $16,000
 


Under subsection (4), the cost base of the remainder of the truck is:

$24,000 – $8,640 $15,360 

(5) However, an amount forming part of the * cost base or * reduced
cost base of the asset is not apportioned if, on the facts, that
amount is wholly attributable to the part to which the * CGT event
happened or to the remaining part.

##### 112-35  Assumption of liability rule

If you * acquire a * CGT asset from another entity that is subject to a
liability, the first element of your * cost base and * reduced cost base
of the asset includes the amount of the liability you assume.

Example: You acquire a block of land for $150,000. You pay $50,000 and
assume a liability for an outstanding mortgage of $100,000. The first
element of your cost base and reduced cost base is $150,000.

Note: The first element of cost base is dealt with in subsection 110-25(2).
The first element of reduced cost base is the same: see
subsection 110-55(2).

##### 112-36  Acquisitions of assets involving look-through earnout rights

_Consequences for cost base and reduced cost base_

(1) If you * acquire a * CGT asset because an entity * disposes of the
CGT asset to you, and that disposal causes * CGT event A1 (the
**_first CGT event_** ) to happen:

(a) neither the * cost base nor the * reduced cost base of the CGT
asset includes the value of any * look-through earnout right
relating to the CGT asset and the acquisition; and

under such a look-through earnout right; and

(c) reduce the first element of the CGT asset’s cost base and
reduced cost base by an amount equal to the amount of any
financial benefit that you receive under such a look-through
earnout right.

_Remaking choices affected by the look-through earnout right_

(2) Despite section 103-25, you may remake any choice you made
under this Part or Part 3-3 for a later * CGT event involving the
* CGT asset if:

(a) after the later CGT event, you provide or receive a * financial
benefit under such a * look-through earnout right; and

(b) you remake the choice at or before the time you are required
to lodge your * income tax return for the income year in
which the financial benefit is provided or received.

_Amending assessments affected by the look-through earnout right_

(3) The Commissioner may amend an assessment of a * tax-related
liability if:

(a) an entity provides or receives a * financial benefit under such
a * look-through earnout right; and

(b) the amount of the tax-related liability:

(i) depends on that entity’s taxable income for an income
year in which a * CGT event, involving the * CGT asset,
happens after the first CGT event but before the
financial benefit is provided or received; or

(ii) is otherwise affected by that right’s character as a
look-through earnout right; and

(c) the Commissioner makes the amendment before the end of
the 4-year period starting at the end of the income year in
which the last possible financial benefit becomes or could
become due under the look-through earnout right.

The tax-related liability need not be a liability of that entity.

(4) If at a particular time a right is taken never to have been a
* look-through earnout right because of subsection 118-565(2), the
Commissioner may amend an assessment of a * tax-related liability
for up to 4 years after that time if:

(a) an entity provides or receives a * financial benefit under the
right; and

(b) the amount of the tax-related liability:

(i) depends on that entity’s taxable income for an income
year in which a * CGT event, involving the * CGT asset,
happens after the first CGT event but before the
financial benefit is provided or received; or

(ii) was otherwise affected by that right’s character as a
look-through earnout right before subsection 118-565(2)
applied.

The tax-related liability need not be a liability of that entity.

Note: Subsection 118-565(2) restricts look-through earnout rights to rights
to financial benefits over a period not exceeding 5 years from the end
of the income year in which the first CGT event happens.

(5) If, after providing or receiving a * financial benefit under a right
referred to in subsection (3) or (4):

(a) you are dissatisfied with an assessment referred to in that
subsection; and

(b) the Commissioner notifies you that the Commissioner has
decided under that subsection not to amend your assessment;

you may object against the assessment, to the extent that it does not
take account of that right’s character (as a * look-through earnout
right or not such a right), in the manner set out in Part IVC of the
_Taxation Administration Act 1953_ .

##### 112-140  What is a same-asset roll-over?

A **_same-asset roll-over_** __ allows one entity (the **_transferor_** ) to
disregard a capital gain or loss it makes from disposing of a CGT
asset to, or creating a CGT asset in, another entity (the **_transferee_** ).
Any gain or loss is deferred until another CGT event happens in
relation to the asset (in the hands of the transferee).

All same-asset roll-overs are set out in the table in section 112-150.

##### 112-145  How is the cost base of the asset modified?

If the transferor acquired the asset on or after 20 September 1985:

(a) the first element of the asset’s cost base (in the hands of the
transferee) is replaced by the asset’s cost base at the time the
transferee acquired it; and

(b) the first element of the asset’s reduced cost base (in the hands
of the transferee) is replaced by the asset’s reduced cost base
at the time the transferee acquired it.

Note 1: If the transferor acquired the asset before 20 September 1985, the
transferee is taken to have acquired it before that day: see
Subdivision 126-A.

Note 2: The reduced cost base may be further modified if the same asset
roll-over happens after a demerger: see section 125-170.

**Division 114** Indexation of cost base

##### Section 114-1

### Division 114—Indexation of cost base

##### Table of sections

114-1 Indexing elements of cost base

114-5 When indexation relevant

114-10 Requirement for 12 months ownership

114-15 Cost base modifications

114-20 When expenditure is incurred for roll-overs

##### 114-1  Indexing elements of cost base

In working out the * cost base of a * CGT asset * acquired at or
before 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory)
on 21 September 1999, index expenditure incurred at or before that
time in each element. (The expenditure can include giving
property: see section 103-5).

Note 1: Subdivision 960-M shows you how to index amounts. The indexation
does not take account of inflation after 30 September 1999.

Note 2: You have to work out the cost base of a CGT asset if a CGT event
happens in relation to it or if there is a cost base modification.

Note 3: You cannot index expenditure in the third element (costs of
ownership): see subsection 960-275(4).

Note 4: Indexation is not relevant to expenditure incurred after 11.45 am on
21 September 1999 or any expenditure relating to a CGT asset
acquired after that time.

Example: Peter purchases a building as an investment on 1 January 1994 for
$250,000. This amount forms the first element of his cost base.

He sold the building on 1 February 1996.

The index number for the quarter in which he sold the building (the
March quarter 1996) is 119.0. The index number for the quarter in
which he purchased the building (the March quarter 1994) is 110.4.

Applying section 960-275, work out the indexation factor as follows:

119.0
1.078
110.4  

##### 114-5  When indexation relevant

(1) Indexation is only relevant if the * cost base of a * CGT asset is

base is not relevant.

Note 2: Indexation is not relevant to the reduced cost base of a CGT asset.

_Indexation for some entities only if indexation chosen_

(2) Indexation is _not_ relevant to the * capital gain of an entity
mentioned in an item of the table from a * CGT event happening

**Division 114** Indexation of cost base

##### Section 114-10

11.45 am on 21 September 1999 and before 1 July 2000 unless the
company or organisation chooses it.

##### 114-10  Requirement for 12 months ownership

(1) You only index expenditure in the * cost base of a * CGT asset for a
* CGT event happening in relation to the asset if you, or the entity
whose cost base is being worked out, had * acquired the asset at or
before 11.45 am (by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory)
on 21 September 1999 and at least 12 months before the time of
that * CGT event.

Note: Generally, expenditure is indexed from when it is incurred: see
subsection 960-275(2). The exception is when there is an acquisition
that did not result from a CGT event. The first element in this case is
indexed from when the expenditure was paid: see
subsection 960-275(3).

(2) There are 5 exceptions:

- one for * CGT event E8: see subsection (3); and

- one for roll-overs: see subsections (4) and (5); and

- one for deceased estates: see subsection (6); and

- one for a surviving joint tenant: see subsection (7); and

- one for * CGT event J1: see subsection (8).

_CGT event E8_

(3) For * CGT event E8, the beneficiary indexes the * cost bases of the
* CGT assets of the trust only if the beneficiary * acquired the * CGT
asset that is the interest in the trust capital at least 12 months before
* disposing of it.

It does not matter (for indexation from the beneficiary’s point of
view) how long the trustee owned any of the assets of the trust.

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Indexation of cost base **Division 114**

##### Section 114-10

_Same asset roll-overs_

(4) The 12 month rule is satisfied for both the entity that owned a
* CGT asset before a * same-asset roll-over and the entity that
owned it after the roll-over if the sum of their periods of ownership
of the asset (and the sum of the periods of ownership of the asset of
other entities involved in an unbroken series of roll-overs) is at
least 12 months.

_Replacement asset roll-overs_

(5) The 12 month rule is satisfied for an entity obtaining a
* replacement-asset roll-over for a * CGT event happening in
relation to a * CGT asset if the period of the entity’s ownership of
the original asset (and of other assets for an unbroken series of
replacement-asset roll-overs) and of the replacement asset are
together at least 12 months.

Example: Company A transfers a CGT asset to Company B (which is a member
of the same wholly-owned group and a foreign resident) 5 months
after acquiring it. There is a roll-over for the transfer under
Subdivision 126-B.

Company B sells the asset 8 months after the transfer.

Company A indexes expenditure in its cost base up to the transfer.
That cost base becomes the first element of Company B’s cost base.
Company B indexes its cost base from the transfer to the sale.

_Deceased estates_

(6) If a * CGT asset you owned just before dying devolves to your
* legal personal representative or * passes to a beneficiary in your
estate, the 12 month rule applies to the legal personal
representative or the beneficiary as if that entity had * acquired the
asset when you acquired it.

_Surviving joint tenant_

(7) If individuals own a * CGT asset as joint tenants and one of them
dies, the 12 month rule applies to the surviving joint tenant as if the

surviving joint tenant had * acquired the deceased’s interest in the
asset when the deceased acquired it.

Note: The surviving joint tenant is taken to have acquired the deceased’s
interest in the asset: see section 128-50.

_CGT event J1_

(8) If * CGT event J1 happens, the company that owns the roll-over
asset ignores (for indexation purposes) the acquisition rule in
subsection 104-175(8).

##### 114-15  Cost base modifications

(1) There are a number of modifications to the * cost base of * CGT
assets (see sections 112-20 and 112-35 and Subdivisions 112-B,
112-C and 112-D). These affect the way indexation works.

(2) If a cost base modification replaces an element of the * cost base of
a * CGT asset with an amount, or includes an amount in such an
element, you index the element or the amount as if expenditure
equal to the amount had been incurred in the * quarter in which the
modification occurred.

Example: A trust is declared over a CGT asset (an example of CGT event E1).
The first element of the cost base in the hands of the trustee is its
market value. The trustee indexes that market value from the quarter
in which the trust was declared.

(3) A different rule applies if a cost base modification reduces the _total_ 
* cost base of a * CGT asset.

_Method statement_

Step 1. Work out the * cost base (all elements) of the asset as at
the * quarter in which the modification occurred.

Step 2. Subtract the amount of the reduction.

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Indexation of cost base **Division 114**

##### Section 114-15

Step 3. The Step 2 amount forms a new first element of your
* cost base, and is later indexed as if you had incurred
expenditure equal to that amount in the * quarter in which
the modification occurred.

Example: Margaret receives a capital payment of $1,000 for shares (an example
of CGT event G1). The first element of her cost base is $10,250
(indexed to the quarter in which the payment was made) and the
second element (similarly indexed) is $210. Add those amounts
($10,460) and subtract the $1,000. Her new first element of the cost
base is $9,460. There are no other elements at that time.

(4) Despite subsection (2), there are different rules for the exercise of
an option or the conversion of a * convertible interest.

_Exercise of options_

(5) The amount you paid for the option, and the amount you paid to
exercise it, are indexed from the * quarter in which the liabilities to
pay the amounts were incurred.

Example: On 1 April 1997, Robyn grants Andrew an option to buy land she
owns. The option fee is $10,000, and the option is to buy the land on
30 June 1998 for $100,000.

Andrew exercises the option and acquires the land on 30 June 1998.
To work out whether there is a capital gain when Andrew disposes of
the land, indexation is available if the land is disposed of 12 months or
more after its acquisition.

The $10,000 option fee can be indexed from 1 April 1997 (when the
liability to pay it was incurred). The $100,000 exercise price can be
indexed from 30 June 1998 (when the liability to pay the price was
incurred).

_Convertible interests_

(6) If you * acquire * shares in a company or units in a unit trust by
converting a * convertible interest, the amount paid for the
convertible interest, and the amount paid to convert it, are indexed
from the * quarter in which the liabilities to pay the amounts were
incurred.

the company or trust on the shares or units after the day of acquisition,
that amount is indexed from the time it is paid: see
subsection 960-275(3).

##### 114-20  When expenditure is incurred for roll-overs

If there is a roll-over for a * CGT event happening in relation to a
* CGT asset and the first element of the * cost base of the asset is the
whole of the cost base of:

(a) for a * replacement-asset roll-over, the original asset; or

(b) for a * same-asset roll-over, the CGT asset;

you index that element as if expenditure equal to the amount in that
element had been incurred in the * quarter in which the CGT event
happened.

##### Table of Subdivisions

Guide to Division 115

#### Guide to Division 115

##### 115-1  What this Division is about

A discount capital gain remaining after the application of any
capital losses and net capital losses from previous income years is
reduced by the discount percentage when working out your net
capital gain.

A capital gain from a CGT asset is a discount capital gain only if
the entity making the gain acquired the asset at least a year before
the CGT event causing the gain and no choice has been made to
include indexation in the cost base of the asset.

Special rules apply to the net income of trusts with net capital
gains, to ensure that the appropriate discount percentage is applied
and to let beneficiaries apply their capital losses against their share
of the trust’s capital gains.

Special rules apply to certain capital gains made by listed
investment companies to enable shareholders receiving dividends
that include these gains to obtain benefits similar to those conferred
by the CGT discount.

Discount capital gains and trusts’ net capital gains **Division 115**

##### Section 115-15

(c) a trust; or

(d) a * life insurance company in relation to a * discount capital
gain from a * CGT event in respect of a * CGT asset that is a
* complying superannuation asset.

##### 115-15  Discount capital gain must be made after 21 September 1999

To be a * discount capital gain, the * capital gain must result from a
* CGT event happening after 11.45 am (by legal time in the
Australian Capital Territory) on 21 September 1999.

##### 115-20  Discount capital gain must not have indexed cost base

(1) To be a * discount capital gain, the * capital gain must have been
worked out:

(a) using a * cost base that has been calculated without reference
to indexation at any time; or

(b) for a capital gain that arose under * CGT event K7—using the
* cost of the * depreciating asset concerned.

Note: A listed investment company must also calculate capital gains without
reference to indexation in order to allow its shareholders to access the
concessions in Subdivision 115-D.

(2) For the purposes of working out whether the * capital gain is a
* discount capital gain and the amount of that gain, the * cost base
taken into account in working out the capital gain may be
recalculated without reference to indexation if the cost base had an
element including indexation because of another provision of this
Act. This subsection has effect despite that other provision.

Note: This lets a capital gain of an entity (the **_gain entity_** ) on a CGT asset be
a discount capital gain even if:
(a) another provision of this Act (such as a provision for a
same-asset roll-over or Division 128) set the gain entity’s cost
base for the asset by reference to the cost base for the asset when
it was owned by another entity (the **_earlier owner_** ), and the
earlier owner’s cost base for the asset included indexation; or

(b) another provision of this Act (such as a provision for a
replacement-asset roll-over) set the cost base of the asset by

reference to the cost base of the original asset involved in the
roll-over, and the original asset’s cost base included indexation.

Example: In 1995 Elizabeth acquired land from her ex-husband under an order
made by a court under the _Family Law Act 1975_ . Former
section 160ZZM of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ treated her
as having paid $56,000 for the land, equal to her ex-husband’s _indexed_ 
cost base for it. His cost base for the land then was $40,000.

In 2000, she sold the land for capital proceeds of $150,000.

Her discount capital gain on the land is $110,000 (equal to the capital
proceeds less the cost base for the land without indexation).

(3) This section does not apply to a * capital gain worked out under
subsection 104-255(3) (about carried interests).

##### 115-25  Discount capital gain must be on asset acquired at least 12
##### months before

(1) To be a * discount capital gain, the * capital gain must result from a
* CGT event happening to a * CGT asset that was * acquired by the
entity making the capital gain at least 12 months before the CGT
event.

Note 1: Even if the capital gain results from a CGT event happening at least a
year after the CGT asset was acquired, the gain may not be a discount
capital gain, depending on the cause of the CGT event (see
section 115-40) and the nature of the asset (see sections 115-45 and
115-50).

Note 2: Section 115-30 or 115-34 may affect the time when the entity is
treated as having acquired the CGT asset.

(2) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) applies to the * CGT asset shown in
the table for a * CGT event listed in the table.

**CGT assets to which subsection (1) applies**

**Item** **CGT event** **CGT asset to which subsection (1) applies**

(2A) If the * capital gain results from a * CGT event K9 happening:

(a) subsection (1) does not apply; and

(b) to be a * discount capital gain, the * carried interest to which
the CGT event relates must arise under a partnership
agreement entered into at least 12 months before the CGT
event.

(3) A * capital gain from one of these * CGT events is _not_ a **_discount_**

(b)  * CGT event D2;

(i)  * CGT event K10.

Note: Capital gains from the CGT events mentioned in paragraphs (3)(a) to
(f) are not discount capital gains because the CGT asset involved in
the CGT event comes into existence at the time of the event, so it is
impossible to meet the requirement in this section that the asset have
been acquired at least 12 months before the event.

asset corresponding to it) has
been involved in an
unbroken series of
roll-overs—when the entity
that owned the applicable

deceased individual in a CGT asset the acquirer and the deceased held
as joint tenants immediately before the deceased’s death (or an equal
share of that interest if there are other surviving joint tenants).

of the table in subsection (1) applies in relation to all
* replacement-asset roll-overs, including those covered by
paragraph 115-34(1)(c).

_CGT event E8_

(2) For the purposes of applying sections 115-25 and 115-40 in
relation to * CGT event E8 and the * CGT asset consisting of a
beneficiary’s interest in trust capital, it does not matter how long

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Discount capital gains and trusts’ net capital gains **Division 115**

##### Section 115-200

#### Subdivision 115-C—Rules about trusts with net capital gains

#### Guide to Subdivision 115-C

##### 115-200  What this Division is about

This Subdivision sets out rules for dealing with the net income of a
trust that has a net capital gain. The rules treat parts of the net
income attributable to the trust’s net capital gain as capital gains
made by the beneficiary entitled to those parts. This lets the
beneficiary reduce those parts by any capital losses and unapplied
net capital losses it has.

If the trust’s capital gain was reduced by either the general 50%
discount in step 3 of the method statement in subsection 102-5(1)
or by the small business 50% reduction in Subdivision 152-C (but
not both), then the gain is doubled. The beneficiary can then apply
its capital losses to the gain before applying the appropriate
discount percentage (if any) or the small business 50% reduction.

If the trust’s capital gain was reduced by both the general 50%
discount and the small business 50% reduction, then the gain is
multiplied by 4. The beneficiary can then apply its capital losses to
the gain before applying the appropriate discount percentage (if
any) and the small business 50% reduction.

Division 6E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ will
exclude amounts from the beneficiary’s assessable income if
necessary to prevent it from being taxed twice on the same parts of
the trust’s net income.

#### Operative provisions

##### 115-210  When this Subdivision applies

(1) This Subdivision applies if a trust estate has a * net capital gain for
an income year that is taken into account in working out the trust
estate’s net income (as defined in section 95 of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ ) for the income year.

(2) If the trust estate has a beneficiary that is a * complying
superannuation entity that is a trust, this Subdivision applies in
relation to the complying superannuation entity as a beneficiary but
not as a trust estate. This Subdivision does not apply otherwise to a
* complying superannuation entity that is a trust.

##### 115-215  Assessing presently entitled beneficiaries

_Purpose_

(1) The purpose of this section is to ensure that appropriate amounts of
the trust estate’s net income attributable to the trust estate’s * capital
gains are treated as a beneficiary’s capital gains when assessing the
beneficiary, so:

(a) the beneficiary can apply * capital losses against gains; and

(b) the beneficiary can apply the appropriate * discount
percentage (if any) to gains.

_Extra capital gains_

(3) If you are a beneficiary of the trust estate, for each * capital gain of
the trust estate, Division 102 applies to you as if you had:

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Discount capital gains and trusts’ net capital gains **Division 115**

##### Section 115-215

(a) if the capital gain was not reduced under either step 3 of the
method statement in subsection 102-5(1) (discount capital
gains) or Subdivision 152-C (small business 50%
reduction)—a capital gain equal to the amount mentioned in
subsection 115-225(1); and

(b) if the capital gain was reduced under either step 3 of the
method statement or Subdivision 152-C but not both (even if
it was further reduced by the other small business
concessions)—a capital gain equal to twice the amount
mentioned in subsection 115-225(1); and

(c) if the capital gain was reduced under both step 3 of the
method statement and Subdivision 152-C (even if it was
further reduced by the other small business concessions)—a
capital gain equal to 4 times the amount mentioned in
subsection 115-225(1).

Note: This subsection does not affect the amount (if any) included in your
assessable income under Division 6 of Part III of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ because of the capital gain of the trust estate _._ 
However, Division 6E of that Part may have the effect of reducing the
amount included in your assessable income under Division 6 of that
Part by an amount related to the capital gain you have under this
subsection.

(4) For each * capital gain of yours mentioned in paragraph (3)(b) or
(c):

(a) if the relevant trust gain was reduced under step 3 of the
method statement in subsection 102-5(1)—Division 102 also
applies to you as if your capital gain were a * discount capital
gain, if you are the kind of entity that can have a discount
capital gain; and

(b) if the relevant trust gain was reduced under
Subdivision 152-C—the capital gain remaining after you
apply step 3 of the method statement is reduced by 50%.

Note: This ensures that your share of the trust estate’s net capital gain is
taxed as if it were a capital gain you made (assuming you made the
same choices about cost bases including indexation as the trustee).

be assessed (and pay tax) under section 98 of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ in relation to the trust estate in respect of the

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Discount capital gains and trusts’ net capital gains **Division 115**

##### Section 115-280

(ba) if, when the dividend is paid, you are an individual who is a
foreign resident and has in Australia such a permanent
establishment—the dividend is attributable to the permanent
establishment; and

(c) all or some part of the dividend is reasonably attributable to a
* LIC capital gain made by a * listed investment company; and

(d) in a case where the LIC capital gain was made by a company
other than the payment company—the payment company
was a listed investment company when it received a dividend
part of which is attributable to the LIC capital gain.

Note: The concession is available for LIC capital gains made directly by a
listed investment company, and for LIC capital gains that company
receives as a dividend through one or more other listed investment
companies.

(2) The amount you can deduct is:

(a) 50% of your share of the amount (the **_attributable part_** )
worked out under subsection (3) if you are an individual, a
trust (except a trust that is a * complying superannuation
entity) or a partnership; or

(b) 33 1 / 3 % of your share of the attributable part if you are a
complying superannuation entity or a * life insurance
company.

Note 1: The listed investment company will advise you of your share of the
attributable part.

Note 2: If a shareholder in a listed investment company is a trust or
partnership, a beneficiary of the trust or a partner in the partnership
has no share of the attributable part.

(3) The attributable part is worked out using this formula:

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 115** Discount capital gains and trusts’ net capital gains

##### Section 115-280

Example: A listed investment company (which is not a base rate entity) disposes
of a CGT asset for $30,000. The asset had a cost base of $10,000. The
capital gain is therefore $20,000. The company applies a capital loss
of $10,000 against the gain. Its net capital gain is $10,000.

The net capital gain is subject to tax at 30%. The after tax gain is
therefore $7,000.

The company pays a fully franked dividend to Daryl, one of its
shareholders. It advises Daryl that his share of the attributable part of
the dividend is:

$7 $7 0.3 1 – 0.3 $10
     
         
     

Daryl, being an individual, can deduct 50% of $10, which is $5.

(4) An amount is included in your assessable income if:

(a) a deduction is allowed under subsection (1) to a trust or a
partnership; and

(b) you are a beneficiary of the trust or a partner in the
partnership and you are not an individual; and

(c) the income of the trust or partnership is reduced by an
amount because of that deduction; and

(d) a part of the deduction (the **_reduction amount_** ) is reflected in
your share of the net income of the trust or partnership.

(5) The amount included is:

(a) the reduction amount if you are a company, a trust (except a
trust that is a * complying superannuation entity) or a
partnership; or

(b) one-third of the reduction amount if you are a complying
superannuation entity or a * life insurance company.

Example: The Burnett Partnership received a dividend from a listed investment
company. The dividend statement advised that the dividend included a
$100 attributable part. The partnership deducted $50 under this section
in calculating its net income.

The partnership has 2 equal partners, Amy Burnett and Burnett
Consulting Pty Ltd.

Burnett Consulting’s assessable income includes its share of the net
income of the partnership plus $25 (being that part of the $50

share of the partnership net income).

Subsections (4) and (5) do not apply to Amy because she is an
individual.

##### 115-285  Meaning of **_LIC capital gain_**

(1) A **_LIC capital gain_** is a * capital gain:

(a) from a * CGT event that happens on or after 1 July 2001; and

(b) that is made by a company that is a * listed investment
company from a * CGT asset that is an investment to which
paragraph 115-290(1)(c) applies; and

(c) that meets the requirements of sections 115-20 and 115-25;
and

(d) that is not a capital gain that could not be a * discount capital
gain had it been made by an individual because of
section 115-40 or 115-45; and

(e) that is included in the * net capital gain of the company; and

(f) that is reflected in the taxable income of the company for the
income year in which the company had the net capital gain.

Note 1: The listed investment company must be able to demonstrate that at
least some part of the LIC capital gain, whether made by the company
itself or by another listed investment company, remains after claiming
deductions and losses against that income for the income year.

Note 2: Section 115-30 may affect the date of acquisition of a CGT asset for
the purposes of sections 115-25, 115-40 and 115-45.

(2) However, a * capital gain made by a company is not a **_LIC capital_**
**_gain_** if the company:

(a) became a * listed investment company after 1 July 2001; and

(b)  * acquired the * CGT asset concerned before the day on which
it became a listed investment company.

(3) In applying subsection (2), a * CGT asset is treated as if it had been
* acquired by the company _before_ it became a * listed investment
company if the asset would otherwise be treated as being acquired
_after_ that time because of one of these provisions:

##### 116-5  General rules

Section 116-20 sets out the general rules about capital proceeds.
They are relevant to each CGT event that is listed in the table in
section 116-25.

##### 116-10  Modifications to general rules

(1) There are 6 modifications to the general rules that may be relevant.
The table in section 116-25 lists which ones _may_ be relevant to
each CGT event listed in the table.

_Explanation of modifications_

(2) The first is a market value substitution rule. It is relevant if:

- you receive no capital proceeds from a CGT event; or
- some or all of the capital proceeds cannot be valued; or
- you did not deal at arm’s length with another entity in
connection with the event.

(3) The second is an apportionment rule. It is relevant if a payment
you receive in connection with a transaction relates in part only to
a CGT event.

Example: You sell 3 CGT assets for a total of $100,000. The $100,000 needs to
be apportioned between the 3 assets.

(4) The third is a non-receipt rule. It is relevant if you do not receive,
or are not likely to receive, some or all of the capital proceeds from
a CGT event.

(5) The fourth is a repaid rule. It is relevant if you are required to
repay some or all of the capital proceeds from a CGT event.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Capital proceeds **Division 116**

##### Section 116-30

##### 116-30  Market value substitution rule: modification 1

_No capital proceeds_

(1) If you received no * capital proceeds from a * CGT event, you are
taken to have received the * market value of the * CGT asset that is
the subject of the event. (The market value is worked out as at the
time of the event.)

Example: You give a CGT asset to another entity. You are taken to have
received the market value of the CGT asset.

_There are capital proceeds_

(2) The * capital proceeds from a * CGT event are replaced with the
* market value of the * CGT asset that is the subject of the event if:

(a) some or all of those proceeds cannot be valued; or

(b) those capital proceeds are more or less than the market value
of the asset and:

(i) you and the entity that * acquired the asset from you did
_not_ deal with each other at * arm’s length in connection
with the event; or

(ii) the CGT event is CGT event C2 (about cancellation,
surrender and similar endings).

(The market value is worked out as at the time of the event.)

(2A) Subsection (2) does not apply if there is a partial roll-over for the
* CGT event because of section 124-150.

(2B) Subsection (2) does not apply to a situation that would otherwise
be covered by paragraph (2)(b) if the * CGT event is * CGT event
C2 (about cancellation, surrender and similar endings) and the
* CGT asset that is the subject of the event is:

(a) a * share in a company that has at least 300 * members and is
not a company that is covered by section 116-35; or

(b) a unit in a unit trust that has at least 300 unit holders and is
not a trust that is covered by section 116-35.

**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 116** Capital proceeds

##### Section 116-30

Note: So, for one of these assets, the capital proceeds for the cancellation
will be what you actually received.

(2C) Subsection (2) does not apply if:

(a) you are a * complying superannuation fund, a * complying
approved deposit fund or a * pooled superannuation trust; and

(b) the * capital proceeds from the * CGT event exceed the
* market value of the * CGT asset; and

(c) assuming the capital proceeds were your * statutory income,
the proceeds would be * non-arm’s length income.

_Market value for CGT events C2 and D1_

(3) Subsection (1) does not apply to:

(a) these examples of * CGT event C2:

(i) the expiry of a * CGT asset you own;

(ii) the cancellation of your * statutory licence; or

(b)  * CGT event D1 (about creating contractual or other rights).

(3A) If you need to work out the * market value of a * CGT asset that is
the subject of * CGT event C2, work it out as if the event had not
occurred and was never proposed to occur.

Example: A company cancels shares you own in it. You work out the market
value of the shares by disregarding the cancellation.

_CGT assets the subject of certain events_

(4) To avoid doubt, the * CGT asset that is the subject of a * CGT event
specified in this table is the asset so specified.

***** **CGT assets the subject of certain events**

**For this**
***** **CGT event:** **This asset is the subject of the event:**

D1 the right you created

D2 the option you granted

D3 the right you granted

##### Section 116-35

(4) This subsection applies to a trust if an individual owns, or up to 20
individuals own between them, directly or indirectly (through one
or more interposed entities) and for their own benefit, units in the
trust:

(a) carrying * fixed entitlements to at least 75% of the trust’s

(b) if unit holders of the trust have a right to vote in respect of
activities of the trust—carrying at least 75% of the voting
power in the trust.

_Possible variation of rights_

(5) This subsection applies to a company or trust if, because of:

(a) any provision in the entity’s constituent document, or in any
contract, agreement or instrument:

(i) authorising the variation or abrogation of rights
attaching to any of the * shares or units in the entity; or

(ii) relating to the conversion, cancellation, extinguishment
or redemption of any of those shares or units; or

(b) any contract, * arrangement, option or instrument under which
a person has power to acquire any of those shares or units; or

(c) any power, authority or discretion in a person in relation to
the rights attaching to any of those shares or units;

it is reasonable to conclude that the rights attaching to any of those
shares or units are capable of being varied or abrogated in such a
way (even if they are not in fact varied or abrogated in that way)
that, directly or indirectly, subsection (3) or (4) would apply to the
entity.

_Single individual_

(6) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), all of the following are
taken to be a single individual:

(a) an individual, whether or not the individual holds * shares or

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Capital proceeds **Division 116**

##### Section 116-40

(c) for any shares or units in respect of which other individuals
are nominees of the individual or of the individual’s
associates—those other individuals.

##### 116-40  Apportionment rule: modification 2

(1) If you receive a payment in connection with a transaction that
relates to more than one * CGT event, the **_capital proceeds_** from
each event are so much of the payment as is reasonably attributable
to that event.

Example: You sell a block of land and a boat for a total of $100,000. This
transaction involves 2 CGT events.

The $100,000 must be divided among the 2 events. The capital
proceeds from the disposal of the land are so much of the $100,000 as
is reasonably attributable to it. The rest relates to the boat.

(2) If you receive a payment in connection with a transaction that
relates to one * CGT event and something else, the **_capital proceeds_**
from the event are so much of the payment as is reasonably
attributable to the event.

Example: You are an architect. You receive $70,000 for selling a block of land
and giving advice to the new owner. This transaction involves one
CGT event: the disposal of the land.

The capital proceeds from the disposal of the land is so much of the
$70,000 as is reasonably attributable to that disposal.

(3) The payment can include giving property: see section 103-5.

##### 116-45  Non-receipt rule: modification 3

(1) The * capital proceeds from a * CGT event are reduced if:

(a) you are not likely to receive some or all (the **_unpaid amount_** )
of those proceeds; and

(b) this is not because of anything you (or your * associate) have
done or omitted to do; and

(c) you took all reasonable steps to get the unpaid amount paid.

The capital proceeds are reduced by the unpaid amount.

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 116** Capital proceeds

##### Section 116-50

Note: This rule exists because the general rules treat you as having received
an amount when you are entitled to receive it.

Example You sell a painting to another entity for $5,000 (the capital proceeds).
You agree to accept monthly instalments of $100.

You receive $2,000, but then the other entity stops making payments.
It becomes clear that you are not likely to receive the remaining
$3,000. The capital proceeds are reduced to $2,000.

(2) There is a further consequence if:

(a) those proceeds are reduced by the unpaid amount; but

(b) you later receive a part of that amount.

Those proceeds are increased by that part.

(3) This Part and Part 3-3 apply to the debt owed to you (the unpaid
amount) as if it were not a * CGT asset.

##### 116-50  Repaid rule: modification 4

(1) The * capital proceeds from a * CGT event are reduced by:

(a) any part of them that you repay; or

(b) any compensation you pay that can reasonably be regarded as
a repayment of part of them.

However, the capital proceeds are not reduced by any part of the
payment that you can deduct.

Example: You sell a block of land for $50,000 (the capital proceeds). The
purchaser later finds out that you misrepresented a term in the
contract. The purchaser sues you and the court orders you to pay
$10,000 in damages to the purchaser.

The capital proceeds are reduced by $10,000.

(2) The payment can include giving property: see section 103-5.

##### 116-55  Assumption of liability rule: modification 5

The * capital proceeds from a * CGT event are increased if another
entity * acquires the * CGT asset (the subject of the event) subject to
a liability by way of security over the asset.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Capital proceeds **Division 116**

##### Section 116-60

They are increased by the amount of the liability the other entity
assumes.

Example: You sell land for $150,000. You receive $50,000 (the capital
proceeds) and the buyer becomes responsible for a $100,000 liability
under an outstanding mortgage. The capital proceeds are increased by
$100,000 to $150,000.

##### 116-60  Misappropriation rule: modification 6

(1) The * capital proceeds from a * CGT event are reduced if your
employee or * agent misappropriates (whether by theft,
embezzlement, larceny or otherwise) all or part of those proceeds.

Note: This rule exists because the general rules treat you as having received
an amount when you are entitled to receive it.

(2) The * capital proceeds are reduced by the amount misappropriated.

(3) There is a further consequence if:

(a) those proceeds are reduced by the amount misappropriated;
and

(b) you later receive an amount as * recoupment of all or part of
the amount misappropriated.

Those proceeds are increased by the amount received.

(4) This Part and Part 3-3 apply to the debt owed to you (the amount
misappropriated) as if it were not a * CGT asset.

(5) Section 170 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ does not
prevent the amendment of an assessment for the purposes of giving
effect to this section for an income year if:

(a) you discover the misappropriation, or you receive an amount
as * recoupment of all or part of the amount misappropriated,
after you lodged your * income tax return for the income year;
and

(b) the amendment is made at any time during the period of 4
years starting immediately after you discover the
misappropriation or receive the amount.

(1) This section applies if:

(a) you granted, renewed or extended an option to create
(including grant or issue) or * dispose of a * CGT asset; and

(b) another entity exercises the option; and

(c) because of the exercise of the option, you create (including
grant or issue) or dispose of the CGT asset.

(2) The * capital proceeds from the creation (including grant or issue)
or disposal include any payment you received for granting,
renewing or extending the option.

(3) The payment can include giving property: see section 103-5.

##### 116-70  Option requiring both acquisition and disposal etc.

(1) This section applies if:

(a) you granted, renewed or extended an option; and

(b) the option requires you both to * acquire, and to create
(including grant or issue) or * dispose of, a * CGT asset.

(2) The option is treated as 2 separate options and half of the * capital
proceeds from the grant, renewal or extension is attributed to each
option.

##### 116-75  Special rule for CGT event happening to a lease

The * capital proceeds from the expiry, surrender or forfeiture of a
lease include any payment (because of the lease ending) by the
lessor to the lessee for expenditure of a capital nature incurred by
the lessee in making improvements to the leased property.

The payment or expenditure can include giving property: see
section 103-5.

(other than a car, motor cycle or similar vehicle) or a
* collectable of a company or trust; and

(b)  * CGT event A1, C2 or E8 happens to:

(i)  * shares you own in the company (or in a company that
is a member of the same * wholly-owned group); or

(ii) an interest you have in the trust.

Note: The full list of CGT events is in section 104-5.

(2) The * capital proceeds from the event are replaced with the * market
value of the * shares, or the interest in the trust.

The market value is worked out as at the time of the event as if the
fall in market value of the * personal use asset or * collectable had
_not_ occurred.

Note: You may also make a collectable loss: see CGT event K5.

##### 116-85  Section 47A of 1936 Act applying to rolled-over asset

are satisfied.

1 You must have * acquired the asset from a company or * CFC

2 Either:

(a) the company obtained a roll-over for the * CGT event that resulted in
your * acquisition of the asset; or

(b) the * CFC obtained a roll-over for that event in applying Division 7 of
Part X of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ for the purpose of
working out the * attributable income of a company in relation to any
entity except a roll-over under Subdivision 124-J (about Crown leases),
124-K (about depreciating assets) or 124-L (about prospecting and
mining entitlements)

3 The company or * CFC is taken, under section 47A of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ , to have paid you a dividend in relation to that event
and some or all of the dividend is included in your assessable income under
section 44 of that Act

Note: For roll-overs: see Divisions 122, 124 and 126.

(2) The reduction is the lesser of:

(a) the amount of the dividend; and

(b) the amount of any * capital gain that, apart from the roll-over,
the company or * CFC would have made from the * CGT event
if its * capital proceeds from the event had been the asset’s

which the last possible financial benefit becomes or could
become due under the look-through earnout right.

The tax-related liability need not be a liability of that entity.

Note: Subparagraph (b)(ii) covers changes to the amount of that tax-related
liability that happen directly or indirectly because of subsection (1) or
(2).

(4) If at a particular time a right is taken never to have been a
* look-through earnout right because of subsection 118-565(2), the

for up to 4 years after that time if:

(a) an entity provides or receives a * financial benefit under the

Gayle can deduct $6 as the taxable use portion of the decline in value
under Division 40:

34
31
177  

Due to the balancing adjustment event that occurred on 2 January
2002, $54 is included in Gayle’s assessable income for the 2001-02
income year under section 40-285. The amount is reduced for
non-taxable use by section 40-290.

A capital gain of $202 is disregarded under this section because the
asset is a collectable acquired for less than $500.

(2) However, there is a special rule if the * collectable is an interest in
one of these * CGT assets:

(a)  * artwork, jewellery, an antique, or a coin or medallion;

(b) a rare folio, manuscript or book;

(c) a postage stamp or first day cover.

A * capital gain or * capital loss you make from the interest is
disregarded only if the * market value of the asset (when you
* acquired the interest) is $500 or less.

Note: If you last acquired the interest before 16 December 1995, a capital
gain or loss is disregarded if you acquired the _interest_ for $500 or less:
see section 118-10 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act_
_1997_ .

(3) A * capital gain you make from a * personal use asset, or part of the
asset, is disregarded if the first element of the asset’s * cost base, or
the first element of its * cost if it is a * depreciating asset, is $10,000
or less.

Note: A capital loss you make from a personal use asset is disregarded: see
subsection 108-20(1).

you used solely to produce your * exempt income or
* non-assessable non-exempt income is disregarded.

(2) However, the exemption does not apply if the asset was used to

(vi) subsection 99B(2A) (attributed trust income);

(vii) section 128D (dividends, royalties and interest subject
to withholding tax);

(viii) subsection 271-105(3) in Schedule 2F (amounts subject
to family trust distribution tax).

Note: These provisions make amounts non-assessable non-exempt income to
prevent them being double taxed rather than to remove them entirely
from the taxation system. Therefore, the policy reason for
disregarding gains and losses does not apply to assets used to produce
those amounts.

A * capital gain or * capital loss you make from a * CGT event
happening in relation to * shares in a * PDF is disregarded.

(a) your assessable income or * exempt income; or

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 118** Exemptions

##### Section 118-20

(a) your assessable income or * exempt income; or

(b) if you are a partner in a partnership, the assessable income or
exempt income of the partnership;

in relation to a * CGT asset as if it were so included because of the
* CGT event referred to in that subsection if the amount would also
be taken into account in working out the amount of a * capital gain
you make.

Note: An example is an amount assessable under Division 16E of Part III of
the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ , which deals with accruals
taxation of certain securities.

(1B) The rule in subsection (1) does not apply to:

(a) an amount that is taken to be a dividend under
section 159GZZZP of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ 
(which relates to buy-backs of * shares); or

(b) an amount included in assessable income under
subsection 207-20(1), 207-35(1) or 207-35(3) of this Act
(which relate to franked distributions).

(2) The gain is reduced to zero if it does _not_ exceed:

(a) the amount included; or

(b) if you are a partner, your share (the **_partner’s share_** ) of the
amount included in the assessable income or * exempt income
of the partnership (calculated according to your entitlement
to share in the partnership net income or loss).

Example: Liz bought some land in 1990, as part of a profit-making scheme. In
December 1998 she sells it.

Her profit from the sale is $40,000 and is included in her assessable
income under section 6-5 (about ordinary income).

Suppose she made a capital gain from the sale of $30,000. It is
reduced to zero because it is does not exceed the amount included.

(3) The gain is reduced by the amount included, or the amount of the
partner’s share, if the gain exceeds that amount.

Note: These rules are modified for complying superannuation funds that
become non-complying and for foreign superannuation funds that
become Australian superannuation funds: see Division 295.

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Exemptions **Division 118**

##### Section 118-20

(4) A * capital gain you make from a * CGT event is reduced by the
extent that a provision of this Act (except sections 59-40 and
316-255) treats:

(a) an amount of your * ordinary income or * statutory income
from the event as being * non-assessable non-exempt income;
or

(b) if you are a partner, your share of the ordinary income or
* statutory income of the partnership from the event
(calculated according to your entitlement to share in the
partnership net income or loss) as being non-assessable
non-exempt income of the partnership.

(4A) A * capital gain the trustee of a * superannuation fund makes from a
* CGT event happening in relation to a * CGT asset in an income
year is reduced if the asset’s * market value was taken into account
in working out the fund’s income from previous years under
section 295-325 or 295-330.

(4B) The gain is reduced to zero if it does not exceed the amount that
would have been the * capital gain from the * CGT event if the
* capital proceeds from the event were the asset’s * market value that
was taken into account in working out that net previous income.
If the gain exceeds that amount, it is reduced by that amount.

_Exceptions_

(5) The gain is not reduced if an amount is included in your assessable
income, or the assessable income of the partnership, for any
income year because of a balancing adjustment.

(6) The gain is not reduced if an amount is included in your
* non-assessable non-exempt income under section 768-5 (about
foreign equity distributions on participation interests) because a
company makes a * foreign equity distribution that is:

(a) debited against a * share capital account of the company; or
(c) debited against an asset revaluation reserve of the company;
or

**_time_** ); and

(b) from the acquisition time until the time your former partner’s
ownership interest ended:

(i) you had used the * dwelling in the same way that your
former partner used it; and

(ii) the dwelling had been your main residence for the same

Example 1:Peter (the transferor spouse) is the 100% owner of a dwelling that he
uses only as a main residence before transferring it to Susan (the
transferee spouse). Susan uses the dwelling only as a rental property.

Susan will be eligible for a partial main residence exemption having
regard to how both Peter and Susan used the dwelling if, at the time
the dwelling is sold, Susan is an Australian resident.

Example 2:Caroline (the transferor spouse) is the 100% owner of a dwelling that
she uses only as a rental property before transferring it to David (the
transferee spouse). David uses the dwelling only as a main residence.

David will be eligible for only a partial main residence exemption

##### Section 118-185

Subdivision that would allow you to treat it as your main residence
during the period.

#### Partial exemption rules

##### 118-185  Partial exemption where dwelling was your main residence
##### during part only of ownership period

(1) You get only a partial exemption for a * CGT event that happens in
relation to a * dwelling or your * ownership interest in it if:

(a) you are an individual; and

(b) the dwelling was your main residence for part only of your
* ownership period; and

(c) the interest did not * pass to you as a beneficiary in, and you
did not * acquire it as a trustee of, the estate of a deceased
person.

(2) You calculate your * capital gain or * capital loss using the formula:

Non-main residence days
CG or CL amount
Days in your *ownership period


where:

**_CG or CL amount_** is the * capital gain or * capital loss you would
have made from the * CGT event apart from this Subdivision.

**_non-main residence days_** is the number of days in your * ownership
period when the * dwelling was not your main residence.

Note: The capital gain or loss may be further adjusted if the dwelling was
used to produce assessable income: see section 118-190.

Example: You bought a house in July 2020 and moved in immediately. In July
2023, you moved out and began to rent it. You sold it in July 2030,
making (apart from this Subdivision) a capital gain of $10,000. At the
time you sold the house, you were an Australian resident.

You choose to continue to treat the dwelling as your main residence
under section 118-145 (about absences) for the first 6 of the 7 years
during which you rented the house out.

##### Section 118-190

Under this section, you will be taken to have made a capital gain of:

365
$10,000 $1,000
3,650
 

(3) However, this section does not apply if, at the time the * CGT event
happens, you:

(a) are an * excluded foreign resident; or

(b) are a foreign resident who does not satisfy the * life events
test.

##### 118-190  Use of dwelling for producing assessable income

(1) You get only a partial exemption for a * CGT event that happens in
relation to a * dwelling or your * ownership interest in it if:

(a) apart from this section, because the dwelling was your main
residence or someone else’s during a period:

(i) you would not make a * capital gain or * capital loss from
the event; or

(ii) you would make a lesser capital gain or loss than if this
Subdivision had not applied; and

(b) the dwelling was used for the * purpose of producing
assessable income during all or a part of that period; and

(c) if you had incurred interest on money borrowed to * acquire
the dwelling, or your ownership interest in it, you could have
deducted some or all of that interest.

Example: You acquire a house as a beneficiary in a deceased estate, rent it out
for 12 months and sell it within 2 years of the deceased’s death. You
can ignore the rental because the exemption does not require the house
to be your main residence during the 2 years after the death.

##### Section 118-190

(3) However, you ignore any use of the * dwelling for the * purpose of
producing assessable income during any period that you continue
to treat it as your main residence under section 118-145 (about
absences) to the extent that any part of it was not used for that
purpose just before it last ceased to be your main residence.

Example: To continue the example from section 118-185, assume that, when
you moved in, you used 1 / 4 of the house as a doctor’s surgery.

Under section 118-185, your capital gain was $1,000.

Under this section, it would be reasonable to add an amount of:

9 1
$10,000 $2,250
10 4

You have a total capital gain of $3,250 on the sale of the house.

(3A) Also, you ignore any use of the * dwelling for the * purpose of
producing assessable income during any period that you treat it as
your main residence under section 118-147 (about absences) to the
extent that any part of the old dwelling mentioned in that section
was not used for that purpose just before the old dwelling last
ceased to be your main residence.

(4) If a * dwelling or your * ownership interest in a dwelling * passed to
you as a beneficiary in a deceased estate, or you owned it as the
trustee of a deceased estate, you ignore any use of the * dwelling for
the * purpose of producing assessable income before the deceased’s
death if:

(a) the dwelling was the deceased’s main residence just before
the death; and

(b) it was not being used for that purpose just before the death,
or any use for that purpose just before the death was ignored
because of subsection (3).

**_income time_** ) it was used for that purpose during your
ownership period.

(2) You are taken to have * acquired the * dwelling or your * ownership
interest at the income time for its * market value at that time.

(3) If your * ownership interest in the * dwelling * passed to you as a

of the deceased’s death, you apply this Subdivision as if:

(a) you had * acquired the interest as an individual and not as a
beneficiary or trustee of a deceased estate; and

(b) for applying the formula in section 118-185, your _non-main_
_residence days_ were the number of days in your * ownership
period when the dwelling was not the main residence of an

#### Operative provisions

##### 118-405  Exemption for certain foreign venture capital investments
##### through venture capital limited partnerships

_General_

(1) All of your share in a * capital gain or a * capital loss from a * CGT
event is disregarded if:

(a) you are an * eligible venture capital partner in a * limited
partnership; and

(b) the CGT event relates to an investment that the partnership
made that is an * eligible venture capital investment; and

(c) when the partnership made the investment, the partnership
was a * venture capital limited partnership that was
* unconditionally registered; and

(d) at the time of the CGT event, the partnership:

(i) owned the investment; and

(ii) had owned the investment for at least 12 months; and

(iii) was a venture capital limited partnership that was
unconditionally registered; and

(iv) in the case of a capital gain—met all of the * registration
requirements of a VCLP that are not * investment
registration requirements.

Note: The registration requirements of a VCLP are set out in section 9-1 of
the _Venture Capital Act 2002_ . It is important to understand that this is
a separate requirement from registration under Part 2 of that Act
(which effectively determines whether an entity is a VCLP).

It is technically possible to be registered under Part 2 of that Act
without meeting the registration requirements of a VCLP, but you
might still not be entitled to exemption under this section.

**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules
**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics
**Division 118** Exemptions

##### Section 118-407

##### 118-407  Exemption for certain venture capital investments through
##### early stage venture capital limited partnerships

_General_

(1) All of your share in a * capital gain or a * capital loss from a * CGT
event is disregarded if:

(a) you are a partner in a * limited partnership; and

(b) the CGT event relates to an investment that the partnership
made that:

(i) is an * eligible venture capital investment; and

(ii) meets all of the * additional investment requirements for
ESVCLPs for the investment; and

(c) when the partnership made the investment, the partnership
was an * early stage venture capital limited partnership that
was * unconditionally registered; and

(d) at the time of the CGT event, the partnership:

(i) owned the investment; and

(ii) had owned the investment for at least 12 months; and

(iii) was an early stage venture capital limited partnership
that was unconditionally registered; and

(iv) in the case of a capital gain—met all of the * registration
requirements of an ESVCLP that are not * investment
registration requirements.

Note 1: The registration requirements of an ESVCLP are set out in section 9-3
of the _Venture Capital Act 2002_ . It is important to understand that this
is a separate requirement from registration under Part 2 of that Act
(which effectively determines whether an entity is an ESVCLP).

It is technically possible to be registered under Part 2 of that Act
without meeting the registration requirements of an ESVCLP, but you
might still not be entitled to exemption under this section.

Note 2: This section does not apply if you get a partial exemption in relation
to a CGT event under section 118-408.

for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(d)(ii), as having owned the

period of 6 months after the end of the earliest of those
valuation years.

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Exemptions **Division 118**

##### Section 118-408

(2) If subsection (1) applies, work out your * capital gain using the
formula:

Normal capital gain Valuation year capital gain 

where:

**_normal capital gain_** is what your * capital gain from the * CGT
event would be apart from section 118-407 and this section.

**_valuation year capital gain_** is the capital gain you would have
made in relation to the * CGT event if the CGT event had
happened:

(a) if there is only one valuation year—at the end of the period
of 6 months after the end of that valuation year; or

(b) if there is more than one valuation year—at the end of the
period of 6 months after the end of the earliest of those
valuation years.

Work out the capital gain based on what the * capital proceeds
would have been, and on other matters relating to the amount of
the gain being determined on a reasonable basis, if the CGT event
resulting in the gain had happened at the end of that period.

(3) Despite subsection (2), you are taken not to have a * capital gain, or
a * capital loss, from the * CGT event if the amount worked out
under the formula in that subsection would be less than zero.

(4) This subsection applies to any income year that:

(a) precedes the income year in which the * CGT event happens;
but

(b) does not precede the income year in which the investment
was made.

Note: There must always be at least one valuation year, because
paragraph 118-407(1)(d) ensures the CGT event will not happen in the
year the investment was made.

(5) Section 118-407 does not apply in relation to a * CGT event if this
section applies in relation to the CGT event.

##### Section 118-525

(ii) a provident, benefit, superannuation or retirement fund;
and

(b) it was established in a foreign country; and

(c) it was established, and is maintained at that time, only to
provide benefits for individuals who are not Australian
residents; and

(d) at that time, its central management and control is carried on

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Exemptions **Division 118**

##### Section 118-525

The company’s ownership of the shares is not at risk, because there is
no possibility that it can lose money under the transaction.

(2) However, * shares or interests in the * resident investment vehicle
issued or allotted to a * venture capital entity are not **_venture capital_**
**_equity_** for the entity if:

(a) one or more of these events happens:

(i) a share or interest in the resident investment vehicle that
was * acquired by some other entity before that issue or
allotment is cancelled or redeemed; or

(ii) there is a return of some of the capital of the resident
investment vehicle that was acquired before that issue or
allotment; or

(iii) value is shifted out of a share or interest in that vehicle
that was acquired before that issue or allotment; and

(b) it is reasonable to conclude that the happening of the event
referred to in paragraph (a) is connected to that issue or
allotment, or to some * arrangement between the entities
concerned.

Example: The capital of an Australian company is 100,000 shares, with a market
value of $1 per share. The shares have full voting and dividend rights.

The Australian company issues another 100,000 shares to a foreign
company. The new shares are issued at one cent each, but have very
limited voting and dividend rights.

The Australian company then changes the rights attaching to its shares
so that the new shares have full voting and dividend rights, and the
original shares have none.

Value has been shifted out of the original shares, effectively
converting “old equity” to “new equity”.

(3) In deciding whether it is reasonable to reach the conclusion
referred to in paragraph (2)(b), these matters are relevant:

(a) whether the amount of the decrease in the * net value of the
* resident investment vehicle because of the happening of the
event referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is the same as, or is
calculated by reference to, the value of the issue or allotment
of * shares or interests to the * venture capital entity; and

Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Exemptions **Division 118**

##### Section 118-560

##### 118-560  Object

(1) This Subdivision and its related provisions set out special rules for
* look-through earnout rights. The object of these rules is to avoid
unnecessary compliance costs and disadvantageous tax outcomes
when entities involved in the sale of a business:

(a) cannot agree on the current value of some or all of the
business’ assets due to uncertainty about the future economic
performance of the business; and

(b) resolve this uncertainty by agreeing to potentially provide
future additional consideration linked to this performance.

(2) These rules achieve this object by:

(a) disregarding any * capital gain or * capital loss relating to the
creation of a * look-through earnout right; and

(b) for the acquirer of the business—treating any * financial
benefits provided (or received) under the right as forming
part of (or reducing) the cost base or reduced cost base of the
business assets; and

(c) for the seller of the business—treating any financial benefits
received (or provided) under the right as increasing (or
reducing) the capital proceeds for the business assets.

Note: Sections 112-36 and 116-120 are 2 of the more important related
provisions that set out these rules.

##### 118-565 **_Look-through earnout rights_**

_Look-through earnout rights—main case_

(1) A **_look-through earnout right_** is a right for which the following
conditions are met:

(a) the right is a right to future * financial benefits that are not
reasonably ascertainable at the time the right is created;

(b) the right is created under an * arrangement that involves the
* disposal of a * CGT asset;

(c) the disposal causes * CGT event A1 to happen;

##### Section 118-565

(d) just before the CGT event, the CGT asset was an * active
asset of the entity who disposed of the asset;

Note: For extra ways to be an active asset, see section 118-570.

(e) all of the financial benefits that can be provided under the
right are to be provided over a period ending no later than 5
years after the end of the income year in which the CGT
event happens;

(f) those financial benefits are contingent on the economic
performance of:

(i) the CGT asset; or

(ii) a business for which it is reasonably expected that the
CGT asset will be an active asset for the period to which
those financial benefits relate;

(g) the value of those financial benefits reasonably relates to that
economic performance;

(h) the parties to the arrangement deal with each other at * arm’s
length in making the arrangement.

_Matters affecting the 5-year maximum period_

(2) The condition in paragraph (1)(e) is not met, and is treated as never
having been met, for the right if:

(a) the * arrangement includes an option to extend or renew the
arrangement; or

(b) the parties to the arrangement vary the arrangement; or

(c) those parties enter into another arrangement over the * CGT
asset or a business for which it is reasonably expected that
the CGT asset will be an * active asset;

so that a party could, or does, provide * financial benefits under the
right (or one or more equivalent rights) over a total period ending
later than 5 years after the end of the income year in which the
* CGT event happens.

out the period over which * financial benefits under a right can be

provided, disregard any part of an * arrangement that allows for an
entity to defer providing such a financial benefit if:

(a) the deferral is contingent on an event happening that is
beyond the control of the parties to the arrangement; and

(b) the deferral cannot change the amount of any financial
benefit provided, or to be provided, under the right; and

(c) when the arrangement is entered into, the contingent event is
not reasonably expected to happen.

_Look-through earnout rights—rights for ending other rights_

(4) A **_look-through earnout right_** is a right to receive one or more
future * financial benefits that:

(a) are for ending a right to which subsection (1) applies; and

(b) are certain.

Note: This subsection will not apply if the old right ends as described in
subsection (2), as subsection (2) causes the old right to be treated as if
it had never been a right to which subsection (1) applies.

##### 118-570  Extra ways a CGT asset can be an active asset

(1) For the purposes of this Subdivision, treat a * CGT asset as if it
were an active asset of an entity at a particular time, if:

(a) the entity owns it at that time; and

(b) it is either a * share in a company, or an interest in a trust; and

(c) at that time, the entity:

(i) is a * CGT concession stakeholder of the company or
trust; or

(ii) if the entity is not an individual—has a * small business
participation percentage in the company or trust of at
least 20%; and

(d) at that time, the company or trust:

(i) is carrying on a * business, and has been carrying on a
business since the start of the most recent income year
ending before that time; and

that assessable income was:

(i) from the carrying on of one or more businesses; but

(ii) not * derived (directly or indirectly) from an asset of a
kind to which paragraph 152-40(4)(d) or (e) applies.

Note: Paragraphs 152-40(4)(d) and (e) refer to financial instruments and
assets used to derive interest, annuities, rent, royalties or foreign
exchange gains.

(2) For the purposes of this Subdivision, treat a * CGT asset as if it
were an active asset of an entity at a particular time, if
subsection 152-40(3) would have been satisfied for the asset at that
time had paragraph 152-40(3)(a) only required the asset to be:

(a) a * share in a company; or

(b) an interest in a trust.

Note: This enables shares and interests in foreign entities to be active assets
for the purposes of this Subdivision.

(3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not limit section 152-40 (about active
assets).

### Division 121—Record keeping

#### Guide to Division 121

You must keep records of matters that affect the capital gains and
losses you make. You must retain them for 5 years after the last
relevant CGT event.

##### Table of sections

**Operative provisions**

121-20 What records you must keep

121-25 How long you must retain the records

121-30 Exceptions

121-35 Asset register entries

#### Operative provisions

##### 121-20  What records you must keep

(1) You must keep records of every act, transaction, event or
circumstance that can reasonably be expected to be relevant to
working out whether you have made a * capital gain or * capital loss
from a * CGT event. (It does not matter whether the CGT event has
already happened or may happen in the future.)

Note 1: There are exceptions: see section 121-30.

Example 1:You dispose of a CGT asset. The records that are relevant to working
out your capital gain or loss are records of:
- the date you acquired the asset;

- the date you disposed of it;

- each element of its cost base and reduced cost base and the effect
of indexation on those elements;

- what you sold it for (the capital proceeds).

Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**

Record keeping **Division 121**

##### Section 121-20

Example 2:Company A disposes of a CGT asset it acquired from company B (a
member of the same wholly-owned group and a foreign resident)
where company B obtained a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B. In
addition to the records mentioned in example 1, company A needs
records showing:
- the status of the 2 companies as members of the group;

- which company is the ultimate holding company in the group;

- the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset in the hands of
company B just before the roll-over (because these become
company A’s cost base and reduced cost base).

Example 3:CGT event G2 (about shifts in share values) happens involving
company X and Greg (a controller (for CGT purposes) of company
X). Z Nominees Pty Ltd (an associate of Greg’s) suffers a material
decrease in the value of its shares in company X as a result of the
shift. Z Nominees needs records showing:
- the essential elements of the relevant scheme;

- the date when the share value shift occurred;

- the amounts of the decreases and increases in the market values
of all shares involved in the scheme;

- if shares are issued at a discount under the scheme, the amount of
the discount;

- the cost bases and market values of the shares that decreased in
value.

Note 2: There is an administrative penalty if you do not keep records as
required by this Division: see section 288-25 in Schedule 1 to the
_Taxation Administration Act 1953_ .

(2) The records must be in English, or be readily accessible and
convertible into English. They must show what is described in this
section. (They **_show_** something if they include whatever material is
necessary for that thing to be easily identified or worked out.)

(3) They must show the nature of the act, transaction, event or
circumstance, the day when it happened or arose and:

(a) in the case of an act—who did it; and

(b) in the case of a transaction—who were the parties to it.

(4) They must show details (including relevant amounts) of how the
act, transaction, event or circumstance is relevant (or can
reasonably be expected to be relevant) to working out whether you
have made a * capital gain or * capital loss from a * CGT event.

**Division 121** Record keeping

##### Section 121-25

(5) If the necessary records of an act, transaction, event or
circumstance do not already exist, you must reconstruct them or
have someone else reconstruct them.

Example: Your capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event may depend on the
market value of property at a particular time. To record that market
value properly, you may need to get a valuation done.

Penalty: 30 penalty units.

Note: See section 4AA of the _Crimes Act 1914_ for the current value of a
penalty unit.

(6) An offence under this section is an offence of strict liability.

Note: For **_strict liability_** , see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_ .

##### 121-25  How long you must retain the records

(1) You must retain records that section 121-20 requires you to keep.

(2) You must retain them until the end of 5 years after it becomes
certain that no * CGT event (or no further * CGT event) can happen
such that the records could reasonably be expected to be relevant to
working out whether you have made a * capital gain or * capital loss
from the event.

(2A) An offence under this section is an offence of strict liability.

Note: For **_strict liability_** , see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_ .

(3) This section has effect despite subsection 262A(4) of the _Income_
_Tax Assessment Act 1936_ (which requires records to be retained for
a different period).

(4) However, it is not necessary to retain records:

(a) if the Commissioner notifies you that you do not need to
retain them; or

(b) for a company that has finally ceased to exist.

Note 1: There are special record keeping rules where there has been a
roll-over for a merger between superannuation funds under former
section 160ZZPI of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ : __ see
section 121-25 of the _Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997_ .

(1) You do not need to keep records under section 121-20 if:

(a) for each * CGT event (if any) that has happened such that the
records are relevant (or could reasonably be expected to be
relevant) to working out whether you have made a * capital
gain or * capital loss from the event; and

(b) for each * CGT event that may happen in the future such that
the records could reasonably be expected to be relevant to
working out whether you might make a * capital gain or
* capital loss from the event;

any capital gain or capital loss you made (or might make) from it is
to be (or would be) disregarded, except because of a roll-over.

(2) However, the exceptions in this section do not apply to a * CGT
event as a result of which a * capital gain or * capital loss is
disregarded under section 855-40 (about capital gains and losses of
foreign residents through * fixed trusts).
