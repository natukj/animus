As a result:(a) the gross outgoings are usually deductible as generaldeductions under section 8-1 (when the trading stockbecomes trading stock on hand); and(b) the gross earnings are usually assessable as ordinaryincome under section 6-5 (when the trading stock stopsbeing trading stock on hand).(3) You must bring to account any difference between the valueof your trading stock on hand at the start and at the end of theincome year. This is done in such a way that, in effect:(a) you account for the value of your trading stock asassessable income; and(b) you carry that value over as a corresponding deductionfor the next income year.Note: You may not have to bring to account that difference if you are asmall business entity: see Division 328.",

Subtract the amount under step 3 from the amount understep 2.Note 1: Step 4 ensures that, before entity maintenancedeductions can contribute to the reduction, they are firstexhausted against any income of the entity that is notpersonal services income.Note 2: If the personal services entity receives anotherindividual\u2019s personal services income, see section 86-25.Step 5.

NewIT\u2019s assessableincome, disregarding Ron\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s personal servicesincome, is $20,000 (step 3).Because the step 4 amount is less than zero (-$12,000), step 5 does notapply and, under step 6, the amount of the reduction is $50,000.Therefore the amount included in Ron\u2019s assessable income is:$120,000 \u2013 $50,000 $70,000 \uf03dExample 2:Assume, as an alternative set of facts, that NewIT\u2019s assessable incomeunder step 3 was only $2,000.The step 4 amount would have been $6,000, and, under step 5, theamount of the reduction would have been $56,000 (adding theamounts under steps 1 and 4).

Your netcapital gain is the total of your capital gains for the income year,reduced by certain capital losses you have made.See later in this Guide (section 100-50) for more detail.(2) When you prepare your income tax return, you need to checkwhether you have made any capital gains for the income year.You also need to check whether you have made any capital losses.You cannot deduct a capital loss from your assessable income, butit will reduce your capital gain in the current income year or laterincome years.(3) You will also need to consider the impact of CGT when doing yourfinancial planning. In particular, you will need adequaterecord-keeping to deal most effectively with any immediate orfuture CGT liability.To give you a sense of the range of things affected by CGT, if youare involved with any of the following, you may have a CGTliability now or at some time in the future:- - leases - - marriage or relationshipbreakdown_____________________________________* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1._130_ _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_Compilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024Authorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024-----Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**A Guide to capital gains and losses **Division 100**##### Section 100-10- - inheritance - - working from home- - shares- -subdividing land- - goodwill - - a civil court case- - contracts - - trusts- - options - - bankruptcy- - incorporating a company- - a companyliquidation- - leavingAustralia_____________________________________* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1._Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ _131_Compilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024Authorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024-----**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics**Division 100** A Guide to capital gains and losses##### Section 100-15##### 100-15  Overview of Steps 1 and 2NoYou do not have acapital gain or lossDid a CGT eventhappen in the incomeyear?YesYesDoes an exemptionapply?Disregard (or reduce)a capital gain or lossfrom the eventNoYesDo the capitalproceeds exceed thecost base?The excess is yourcapital gain from theeventNoYesDoes the reduced costbase exceed thecapital proceeds?The excess is yourcapital loss from theeventNote: Capital proceeds and cost base are not relevant for some CGT events,for example CGT event K7 or any of the CGT events created bySubdivision 104-L._____________________________________* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1._132_ _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_Compilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024Authorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024-----Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**A Guide to capital gains and losses **Division 100**##### Section 100-20",

(For many, there is an_exception_ if the CGT asset was acquired _before_ 20 September1985.) However, many CGT events are concerned directly withcapital receipts and do _not_ involve a CGT asset.See the summary of the CGT events in section 104-5.(2) Some CGT assets are reasonably well-known:- land and buildings, for example, a weekender;- shares;- units in a unit trust;- collectables which cost over $500, for example, jewelleryor an artwork;- personal use assets which cost over $10,000, for example,a boat.(3) Other CGT assets are not so well-known. For example:- your home;- contractual rights;- goodwill;- foreign currency.For a full explanation of what things are CGT assets: see Division 108.##### 100-30  Does an exception or exemption apply?(1) Once you identify a CGT event which applies to you, you need toknow if there is an exception or exemption that would reduce thecapital gain or loss or allow you to disregard it._____________________________________* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1._134_ _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_Compilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024Authorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024-----Specialist liability rules **Chapter 3**Capital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**A Guide to capital gains and losses **Division 100**##### Section 100-33(2) There are 4 categories of exemptions:1. exempt assets: for example, cars;2. exempt or loss-denying transactions: for example,compensation for personal injury or your tenancy comes toan end;3. anti-overlap provisions (that reduce your capital gain by theamount that is otherwise assessable);4. small business relief.Note: Most of the exceptions are in Division 104. You will find most of thepossible exemptions in Division 118. The small business reliefprovisions are in Division 152._Some exemptions are limited_(3) Take the family home for example. Generally, you are exemptfrom CGT when you make a capital gain on disposing of yourmain residence.But this can change depending on how you came to own the houseand what you have done with it. For example, if you rent it out,you may be liable to CGT when you sell it.For the limits on the general exemption of your main residence:see Subdivision 118-B.##### 100-33  Can there be a roll-over?(1) Roll-overs allow you to defer or disregard a capital gain or lossfrom a CGT event. They apply in specific situations. Some requirea choice (for example, where an asset is compulsorily acquired: seeSubdivision 124-B) and some are automatic (for example, wherean asset is transferred because of marriage or relationshipbreakdown: see Subdivision 126-A).(2) There are 2 types of roll-over:1. a _replacement-asset roll-over_ allows you to defer a capitalgain or loss from one CGT event until a later CGT eventhappens where a CGT asset is replaced with another one;_____________________________________* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1._Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ _135_Compilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024Authorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024-----**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics**Division 100** A Guide to capital gains and losses##### Section 100-352. a _same-asset roll-over_ allows you to disregard a capital gainor loss from a CGT event where the same CGT asset isinvolved.Note: The replacement-asset roll-overs are listed in section 112-115, and thesame-asset roll-overs are listed in section 112-150.",
