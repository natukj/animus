As a result:\n\n(a) the gross outgoings are usually deductible as general\ndeductions under section 8-1 (when the trading stock\nbecomes trading stock on hand); and\n\n(b) the gross earnings are usually assessable as ordinary\nincome under section 6-5 (when the trading stock stops\nbeing trading stock on hand).\n\n(3) You must bring to account any difference between the value\nof your trading stock on hand at the start and at the end of the\nincome year. This is done in such a way that, in effect:\n\n(a) you account for the value of your trading stock as\nassessable income; and\n\n(b) you carry that value over as a corresponding deduction\nfor the next income year.\n\nNote: You may not have to bring to account that difference if you are a\nsmall business entity: see Division 328.\n",

In particular, you will need adequate\nrecord-keeping to deal most effectively with any immediate or\nfuture CGT liability.\n\nTo give you a sense of the range of things affected by CGT, if you\nare involved with any of the following, you may have a CGT\nliability now or at some time in the future:\n\n- - leases - - marriage or relationship\nbreakdown\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_130_ _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\nSpecialist liability rules **Chapter 3**\n\nCapital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**\n\nA Guide to capital gains and losses **Division 100**\n\n##### Section 100-10\n\n- - inheritance - - working from home\n\n- - shares\n\n- -\nsubdividing land\n\n- - goodwill - - a civil court case\n\n- - contracts - - trusts\n\n- - options - - bankruptcy\n\n- - incorporating a company\n\n- - a company\nliquidation\n\n- - leaving\nAustralia\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ _131_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules\n**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics\n**Division 100** A Guide to capital gains and losses\n\n##### Section 100-15\n\n##### 100-15  Overview of Steps 1 and 2\n\nNo\n\nYou do not have a\ncapital gain or loss\n\nDid a CGT event\nhappen in the income\nyear?\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nDoes an exemption\napply?\n\nDisregard (or reduce)\na capital gain or loss\nfrom the event\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nDo the capital\nproceeds exceed the\ncost base?\n\nThe excess is your\ncapital gain from the\nevent\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nDoes the reduced cost\nbase exceed the\ncapital proceeds?\n\nThe excess is your\ncapital loss from the\nevent\n\nNote: Capital proceeds and cost base are not relevant for some CGT events,\nfor example CGT event K7 or any of the CGT events created by\nSubdivision 104-L.\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_132_ _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\nSpecialist liability rules **Chapter 3**\n\nCapital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**\n\nA Guide to capital gains and losses **Division 100**\n\n##### Section 100-20\n",

(For many, there is an\n_exception_ if the CGT asset was acquired _before_ 20 September\n1985.) However, many CGT events are concerned directly with\ncapital receipts and do _not_ involve a CGT asset.\n\nSee the summary of the CGT events in section 104-5.\n\n(2) Some CGT assets are reasonably well-known:\n\n- land and buildings, for example, a weekender;\n\n- shares;\n\n- units in a unit trust;\n\n- collectables which cost over $500, for example, jewellery\nor an artwork;\n\n- personal use assets which cost over $10,000, for example,\na boat.\n\n(3) Other CGT assets are not so well-known. For example:\n\n- your home;\n\n- contractual rights;\n\n- goodwill;\n\n- foreign currency.\n\nFor a full explanation of what things are CGT assets: see Division 108.\n\n##### 100-30  Does an exception or exemption apply?\n\n(1) Once you identify a CGT event which applies to you, you need to\nknow if there is an exception or exemption that would reduce the\ncapital gain or loss or allow you to disregard it.\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_134_ _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\nSpecialist liability rules **Chapter 3**\n\nCapital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**\n\nA Guide to capital gains and losses **Division 100**\n\n##### Section 100-33\n\n(2) There are 4 categories of exemptions:\n\n1. exempt assets: for example, cars;\n2. exempt or loss-denying transactions: for example,\ncompensation for personal injury or your tenancy comes to\nan end;\n\n3. anti-overlap provisions (that reduce your capital gain by the\namount that is otherwise assessable);\n\n4. small business relief.\n\nNote: Most of the exceptions are in Division 104. You will find most of the\npossible exemptions in Division 118. The small business relief\nprovisions are in Division 152.\n\n_Some exemptions are limited_\n\n(3) Take the family home for example. Generally, you are exempt\nfrom CGT when you make a capital gain on disposing of your\nmain residence.\n\nBut this can change depending on how you came to own the house\nand what you have done with it. For example, if you rent it out,\nyou may be liable to CGT when you sell it.\n\nFor the limits on the general exemption of your main residence:\nsee Subdivision 118-B.\n\n##### 100-33  Can there be a roll-over?\n\n(1) Roll-overs allow you to defer or disregard a capital gain or loss\nfrom a CGT event. They apply in specific situations. Some require\na choice (for example, where an asset is compulsorily acquired: see\nSubdivision 124-B) and some are automatic (for example, where\nan asset is transferred because of marriage or relationship\nbreakdown: see Subdivision 126-A).\n\n(2) There are 2 types of roll-over:\n\n1. a _replacement-asset roll-over_ allows you to defer a capital\ngain or loss from one CGT event until a later CGT event\nhappens where a CGT asset is replaced with another one;\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ _135_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules\n**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics\n**Division 100** A Guide to capital gains and losses\n\n##### Section 100-35\n\n2. a _same-asset roll-over_ allows you to disregard a capital gain\nor loss from a CGT event where the same CGT asset is\ninvolved.\n\nNote: The replacement-asset roll-overs are listed in section 112-115, and the\nsame-asset roll-overs are listed in section 112-150.\n",

There are no other elements at that time.\n\n(4) Despite subsection (2), there are different rules for the exercise of\nan option or the conversion of a * convertible interest.\n\n_Exercise of options_\n\n(5) The amount you paid for the option, and the amount you paid to\nexercise it, are indexed from the * quarter in which the liabilities to\npay the amounts were incurred.\n\nExample: On 1 April 1997, Robyn grants Andrew an option to buy land she\nowns.

The $100,000 exercise price can be\nindexed from 30 June 1998 (when the liability to pay the price was\nincurred).\n\n_Convertible interests_\n\n(6) If you * acquire * shares in a company or units in a unit trust by\nconverting a * convertible interest, the amount paid for the\nconvertible interest, and the amount paid to convert it, are indexed\nfrom the * quarter in which the liabilities to pay the amounts were\nincurred.\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ _349_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules\n**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics\n**Division 114** Indexation of cost base\n\n##### Section 114-20\n\nNote: If shares or units are acquired as a result of the exercise of the option\nor the conversion of the convertible interest, and an amount is paid to\nthe company or trust on the shares or units after the day of acquisition,\nthat amount is indexed from the time it is paid: see\nsubsection 960-275(3).\n\n##### 114-20  When expenditure is incurred for roll-overs\n\nIf there is a roll-over for a * CGT event happening in relation to a\n* CGT asset and the first element of the * cost base of the asset is the\nwhole of the cost base of:\n\n(a) for a * replacement-asset roll-over, the original asset;

The rules treat parts of the net\nincome attributable to the trust\u2019s net capital gain as capital gains\nmade by the beneficiary entitled to those parts. This lets the\nbeneficiary reduce those parts by any capital losses and unapplied\nnet capital losses it has.\n\nIf the trust\u2019s capital gain was reduced by either the general 50%\ndiscount in step 3 of the method statement in subsection 102-5(1)\nor by the small business 50% reduction in Subdivision 152-C (but\nnot both), then the gain is doubled. The beneficiary can then apply\nits capital losses to the gain before applying the appropriate\ndiscount percentage (if any) or the small business 50% reduction.\n\nIf the trust\u2019s capital gain was reduced by both the general 50%\ndiscount and the small business 50% reduction, then the gain is\nmultiplied by 4. The beneficiary can then apply its capital losses to\nthe gain before applying the appropriate discount percentage (if\nany) and the small business 50% reduction.\n\nDivision 6E of Part III of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ will\nexclude amounts from the beneficiary\u2019s assessable income if\nnecessary to prevent it from being taxed twice on the same parts of\nthe trust\u2019s net income.\n\n##### Table of sections\n\n**Operative provisions**\n\n115-210 When this Subdivision applies\n\n115-215 Assessing presently entitled beneficiaries\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ _377_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules\n**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics\n**Division 115** Discount capital gains and trusts\u2019 net capital gains\n\n##### Section 115-210\n\n115-220 Assessing trustees under section 98 of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_\n\n115-222 Assessing trustees under section 99 or 99A of the _Income Tax Assessment_\n_Act 1936_\n\n115-225 Attributable gain\n\n115-227 _Share_ of a capital gain\n\n115-228 _Specifically entitled_ to an amount of a capital gain\n\n115-230 Choice for resident trustee to be specifically entitled to capital gain\n\n#### Operative provisions\n\n##### 115-210  When this Subdivision applies\n\n(1) This Subdivision applies if a trust estate has a * net capital gain for\nan income year that is taken into account in working out the trust\nestate\u2019s net income (as defined in section 95 of the _Income Tax_\n_Assessment Act 1936_ ) for the income year.\n\n(2) If the trust estate has a beneficiary that is a * complying\nsuperannuation entity that is a trust, this Subdivision applies in\nrelation to the complying superannuation entity as a beneficiary but\nnot as a trust estate.

The records that are relevant to working\nout your capital gain or loss are records of:\n- the date you acquired the asset;\n\n- the date you disposed of it;\n\n- each element of its cost base and reduced cost base and the effect\nof indexation on those elements;\n\n- what you sold it for (the capital proceeds).\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_530_ _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\nSpecialist liability rules **Chapter 3**\n\nCapital gains and losses: general topics **Part 3-1**\n\nRecord keeping **Division 121**\n\n##### Section 121-20\n\nExample 2:Company A disposes of a CGT asset it acquired from company B (a\nmember of the same wholly-owned group and a foreign resident)\nwhere company B obtained a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B. In\naddition to the records mentioned in example 1, company A needs\nrecords showing:\n- the status of the 2 companies as members of the group;\n\n- which company is the ultimate holding company in the group;\n\n- the cost base and reduced cost base of the asset in the hands of\ncompany B just before the roll-over (because these become\ncompany A\u2019s cost base and reduced cost base).\n\nExample 3:CGT event G2 (about shifts in share values) happens involving\ncompany X and Greg (a controller (for CGT purposes) of company\nX). Z Nominees Pty Ltd (an associate of Greg\u2019s) suffers a material\ndecrease in the value of its shares in company X as a result of the\nshift. Z Nominees needs records showing:\n- the essential elements of the relevant scheme;\n\n- the date when the share value shift occurred;\n\n- the amounts of the decreases and increases in the market values\nof all shares involved in the scheme;\n\n- if shares are issued at a discount under the scheme, the amount of\nthe discount;\n\n- the cost bases and market values of the shares that decreased in\nvalue.\n\nNote 2: There is an administrative penalty if you do not keep records as\nrequired by this Division: see section 288-25 in Schedule 1 to the\n_Taxation Administration Act 1953_ .\n\n(2) The records must be in English, or be readily accessible and\nconvertible into English. They must show what is described in this\nsection. (They **_show_** something if they include whatever material is\nnecessary for that thing to be easily identified or worked out.)\n\n(3) They must show the nature of the act, transaction, event or\ncircumstance, the day when it happened or arose and:\n\n(a) in the case of an act\u2014who did it; and\n\n(b) in the case of a transaction\u2014who were the parties to it.\n\n(4) They must show details (including relevant amounts) of how the\nact, transaction, event or circumstance is relevant (or can\nreasonably be expected to be relevant) to working out whether you\nhave made a * capital gain or * capital loss from a * CGT event.\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ _531_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules\n**Part 3-1** Capital gains and losses: general topics\n**Division 121** Record keeping\n\n##### Section 121-25\n\n(5) If the necessary records of an act, transaction, event or\ncircumstance do not already exist, you must reconstruct them or\nhave someone else reconstruct them.\n\nExample: Your capital gain or capital loss from a CGT event may depend on the\nmarket value of property at a particular time.
