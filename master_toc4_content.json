Companies A and B are both\nmembers of a demerger group. Company A is the head entity of the\ndemerger group and Company B is a demerger subsidiary.\n\nCompany A proceeds to demerge 100% of its shares in Company B to\nits shareholders.\n\nCompany A enters into a proportionate capital reduction, returning 40\ncents per share to its ordinary shareholders. Peter is entitled to $160\n(40c times 400 shares) under the capital reduction.\n\nFor Peter, the capital reduction amount of $160 is compulsorily\napplied to acquire Company A\u2019s shares in Company B, at $6.75 (a\ndiscount of 10% to current market value). Company A rounds up the\nfractional amounts in calculating the number of whole shares to be\ndistributed to each shareholder. This gives Peter 24 shares in\nCompany B (160 divided by 6.75, rounded up to the nearest whole\nnumber).\n\nNote: Acquiring new interests by an owner of original interests may include\nthe allocation of the owner\u2019s entitlement to new interests to a\nnominee:\n- to sell on the owner\u2019s behalf;

This\ncomprises its realised losses and unrealised losses on CGT assets.\n\n(2) Special rules, directed at saving compliance costs, apply to\ndetermine whether unrealised losses have to be counted at an\nalteration time and, if so, how to work them out.\n\n(3) The company may not have to calculate its unrealised losses if the\nalteration time is not also a changeover time for the purposes of\nSubdivision 165-CC (about change of ownership or control of a\ncompany that has an unrealised net loss), and the company has no\nrealised losses.\n\n(4) The company does not have to count unrealised losses at an\nalteration time if (together with certain related entities) it has a net\nasset value of not more than $6,000,000 under the test in\nsection 152-15 (for small business CGT relief).\n\n(5) In working out its unrealised losses on CGT assets, the company\ncan choose to work out the * market value of each of its assets\nindividually, or of all of its assets together.\n\n(6) If the company works out the * market value of each of its assets\nindividually, unrealised losses on assets acquired for less than\n$10,000 do not have to be calculated at any time.\n\n(7) Amounts (whether realised or unrealised) counted at a previous\nalteration time are not counted again at a later alteration time.

This\nloss was fully reflected in the market value of shares in Beta Co.\n\nAlpha Co and Gamma Co are not associated in any way.\n\nResult:\n\nStep 1: An alteration time occurred in respect of Beta Co as a result of the\nchange in ownership that occurred when Alpha Co sold its shares.\n\nStep 2: Beta Co was a loss company at the alteration time because it had an\nunapplied net capital loss from an earlier income year.\n\nStep 3: Alpha Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co immediately before\nthe alteration time because it had a controlling stake and significant\ninterest (80% equity interest). Gamma Co did not have a relevant\nequity interest in Beta Co because it did not have a controlling stake.\n\nStep 4: Because Alpha Co had a relevant equity interest in Beta Co, the\nreduced cost bases of its shares in Beta Co are reduced by 80% of\nBeta Co\u2019s net capital loss:\n\n80% $500 $400 \uf0b4 \uf03d\n\nAlpha Co does not make a capital gain on the disposal of its shares in\nBeta Co because the capital proceeds ($600) are less than the cost\nbases ($1,000).\n\nNor did Alpha Co make a capital loss on the disposal of its shares in\nBeta Co because the capital proceeds ($600) are not less than the\nreduced cost bases as further reduced by this Subdivision ($600).\n\nThe net capital loss in Beta Co is not duplicated on the sale of Alpha\nCo\u2019s shares in Beta Co.\n\nStep 5. There are no notice requirements in this simple case.

 Effect of this Subdivision\n\n(1) This Subdivision has effect for the purposes of all * taxation laws,\nto the exclusion of those laws as they would otherwise apply in\nrelation to * CCIVs and their

(in their capacity as such).\n\nNote: For example, in applying subsection 318(1) of the _Income Tax_\n_Assessment Act 1936_ to determine whether a CCIV is an associate of a\nnatural person for the purposes of a provision affecting the income tax\npayable by that person:\n(a) paragraph 318(1)(d) of that Act (providing for when a trustee of\na trust is an associate of the natural person) would

the natural person) would not apply.\n\n(3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to the following * taxation\nlaws:\n\n(a) the _Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975_ ;\n\n(b) legislative instruments made under that Act.\n\n##### 195-110  Each sub-fund of a CCIV is taken to be a separate trust\n\n(1) For each * sub-fund of a * CCIV, the business, * assets and * liabilities\nof the sub-fund are taken to constitute the trust estate of a separate\ntrust, of which the CCIV is the trustee and the * members of the\nsub-fund are the beneficiaries.\n\n(2) A trust that is taken to exist because of the application of\nsubsection (1) to a * sub-fund of a * CCIV is a **_CCIV sub-fund trust_** .\n\nNote: The combined effect of this section and subsections 960-100(2) and\n(3) is that a CCIV is a different entity in its capacity as trustee of each\nof its CCIV sub-fund trusts.\n\nBecause of subsection 195-105(1), the tax treatment of the CCIV in\nthose capacities excludes the tax treatment that would otherwise apply\nto the CCIV as a company. Also, the tax treatment of members of the\nCCIV is based on them being treated as beneficiaries of their\nrespective CCIV sub-fund trusts, to the exclusion of the tax treatment\nthat would otherwise apply to them as members of a company.\n\nExample 1: CCIV A has only one sub-fund (sub-fund A). CCIV B has only one\nsub-fund (sub-fund B).\n\nCCIV A holds shares in CCIV B. The shares are referable to sub-fund\nB. They are assets of sub-fund A.\n\nIn its capacity as trustee of the CCIV sub-fund trust for sub-fund A,\nCCIV A is a beneficiary of the CCIV sub-fund trust for sub-fund B.\n\nExample 2:A CCIV has 2 sub-funds: sub-fund A and sub-fund B.\n\nAs permitted by section 1230Q of the _Corporations Act 2001_ , the\nCCIV acquires, in respect of sub-fund A, shares that are referable to\nsub-fund B. The shares are assets of sub-fund A.\n\nIn its capacity as trustee of the CCIV sub-fund trust for sub-fund A,\nthe CCIV is a beneficiary of the CCIV sub-fund trust for sub-fund B.\n\n_____________________________________\n* To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n_Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ _571_\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\nAuthorised Version C2024C00046 registered 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n**Chapter 3** Specialist liability rules\n**Part 3-5** Corporate taxpayers and corporate distributions\n**Division 195** Special types of company\n\n##### Section 195-115\n\n##### 195-115  A CCIV sub-fund trust is a unit trust\n\n(1) A * CCIV sub-fund trust is taken to be a unit trust.\n\nNote: One consequence of this subsection is that a CCIV sub-fund trust can\nbe a public unit trust if it meets the other tests in section 102P of the\n_Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .\n\n(2) The * shares that are * referable to the * sub-fund are taken to be the\nunits in the trust.\n\n(3) The rights, obligations and other characteristics attaching to a unit\nin the trust are taken to be the same, as nearly as practicable, as the\nrights, obligations and other characteristics attaching to the share\nthat is taken to be that unit.\n\nNote: One consequence of this section is that if shares that are referable to\nthe sub-fund are listed for quotation in the official list of a stock\nexchange, the units in the sub-fund trust that those shares are taken to\nbe will likewise be taken to be listed in that official list.\n\nExamples of provisions to which this is relevant are:\n(a) paragraph 275-20(2)(a) (widely-held requirement for managed\ninvestment trusts) of this Act; and\n\n(b) paragraph 102P(1)(a) of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ \n(public unit trusts).\n\n##### 195-120  Beneficiary of a CCIV sub-fund trust has fixed entitlements\n##### to shares of income and capital of the trust\n\n(1) A * beneficiary of a * CCIV sub-fund trust is taken to have a **_fixed_**\n**_entitlement_** to a share of income of the trust that the trust derives\nfrom time to time.
