##### Section 2-25

##### 2-25  Purposes

###### Two main purposes of the numbering system in this Act are:

###### - ###### To indicate the relationship between units at different
###### levels.

For example, the number of Part 2-15 indicates that the Part is in
Chapter 2. Similarly, the number of section 165-70 indicates that the
section is in Division 165.

###### - ###### To allow for future expansion of the Act. The main
###### technique here is leaving gaps between numbers.

##### 2-30  Gaps in the numbering

###### There are gaps in the numbering system to allow for the insertion
###### of new Divisions and sections.

#### Subdivision 2-E—Status of Guides and other non-operative
#### material

**Division 5** How to work out when to pay your income tax

##### Section 5-5

##### 5-5  When income tax is payable

###### Scope

###### (1) This section tells you when income tax you must pay for a
* financial year is due and payable.

Note: The Commissioner may defer the time at which the income tax is due
and payable: see section 255-10 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation_
_Administration Act 1953_ .

###### (2) The income tax is only due and payable if the Commissioner
###### makes an * assessment of your income tax for the year.

###### (3) However, if the Commissioner does make an * assessment of your
###### income tax for the year, the tax may be taken to have been due and
###### payable at a time before your assessment was made.

Note: This is to ensure that general interest charge begins to accrue from the
same date for all like entities. General interest charge on unpaid
income tax is calculated from when the tax is due and payable, not
from when the assessment is made: see section 5-15.

###### Original assessments—self-assessment entities

###### (4) If you are a * self-assessment entity, the income tax is due and
###### payable on the first day of the sixth month after the end of the
###### income year.

Example: If your income year is the same as the financial year, your income tax
would be due and payable on 1 December.

###### Original assessments—other entities

###### (5) If you are _not_ a * self-assessment entity, the income tax is due and
###### payable 21 days after the day (the **_return day_** ) on or before which
###### you are required to lodge your * income tax return with the
###### Commissioner.

Note: For rules about income tax returns and when they are due, see Part IV
of the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ .

##### Section 5-10

###### (6) However, if you lodge your return _on or before_ the return day and
###### the Commissioner gives you a notice of * assessment (other than an
###### amended assessment) _after_ the return day, the income tax is due
###### and payable 21 days after the Commissioner gives you the notice.

###### Amended assessments

###### (7) If the Commissioner amends your * assessment, any extra income
###### tax resulting from the amendment is due and payable 21 days after
###### the day on which the Commissioner gives you notice of the
###### amended assessment.

Note: Shortfall interest charge may be payable, on any amount of extra
income tax payable as a result of the amended assessment, for each
day in the period that:
(a) starts at the time income tax was due and payable on your
original assessment; and

(b) ends the day before the day on which the Commissioner gives
you notice of the amended assessment.

##### 5-10  When shortfall interest charge is payable

###### An amount of * shortfall interest charge that you are liable to pay is
###### due and payable 21 days after the day on which the Commissioner
###### gives you notice of the charge.

Note: Shortfall interest charge is imposed if the Commissioner amends an
assessment and the amended assessment results in an increase in some
tax payable. For provisions about liability for shortfall interest charge,
see Division 280 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act_
_1953_ .

##### 5-15  General interest charge payable on unpaid income tax or

###### liable to pay remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be
###### paid, you are liable to pay the * general interest charge on the
###### unpaid amount for each day in the period that:

###### (a) starts at the beginning of the day on which the amount was

##### Section 6-5

###### non-assessable non-exempt income) in the hands of a particular
###### entity.

#### Operative provisions

##### 6-5  Income according to ordinary concepts ( **_ordinary income_** **)**

###### (1) Your **_assessable income_** includes income according to ordinary
###### concepts, which is called **_ordinary income_** .

Note: Some of the provisions about assessable income listed in section 10-5
may affect the treatment of ordinary income.

###### (2) If you are an Australian resident, your assessable income includes
###### the * ordinary income you * derived directly or indirectly from all
###### sources, whether in or out of Australia, during the income year.

###### (3) If you are a foreign resident, your assessable income includes:

###### (a) the * ordinary income you * derived directly or indirectly from
###### all * Australian sources during the income year; and

###### (b) other * ordinary income that a provision includes in your
###### assessable income for the income year on some basis other
###### than having an * Australian source.

###### (4) In working out whether you have **_derived_** an amount of * ordinary
###### income, and (if so) when you **_derived_** it, you are taken to have
###### received the amount as soon as it is applied or dealt with in any
###### way on your behalf or as you direct.

##### 6-10  Other assessable income ( **_statutory income_** **)**

###### (1) Your **_assessable income_** also includes some amounts that are _not_ 
* ordinary income.

Note: These are included by provisions about assessable income.
For a summary list of these provisions, see section 10-5.

**Chapter 1** Introduction and core provisions
**Part 1-3** Core provisions
**Division 6** Assessable income and exempt income

##### Section 6-15

###### (2) Amounts that are _not_  * ordinary income, but are included in your
###### assessable income by provisions about assessable income, are
###### called **_statutory income_** .

Note 1: Although an amount is statutory income because it has been included
in assessable income under a provision of this Act, it may be made
exempt income or non-assessable non-exempt income under another
provision: see sections 6-20 and 6-23.

Note 2: Many provisions in the summary list in section 10-5 contain rules
about ordinary income. These rules do not change its character as
ordinary income.

###### (3) If an amount would be * statutory income apart from the fact that
###### you have not received it, it becomes statutory income as soon as it
###### is applied or dealt with in any way on your behalf or as you direct.

###### (4) If you are an Australian resident, your assessable income includes
###### your * statutory income from all sources, whether in or out of
###### Australia.

###### (5) If you are a foreign resident, your assessable income includes:

###### (a) your * statutory income from all * Australian sources; and

###### (b) other * statutory income that a provision includes in your
###### assessable income on some basis other than having an
* Australian source.

##### 6-15  What is **_not_** **assessable income**

###### (1) If an amount is _not_  * ordinary income, and is _not_  * statutory income,
###### it is not **_assessable income_** (so you do not have to pay income tax
###### on it).

###### (2) If an amount is * exempt income, it is not **_assessable income_** .

Note: If an amount is exempt income, there are other consequences besides
it being exempt from income tax. For example:

- the amount may be taken into account in working out the amount
of a tax loss (see section 36-10);

##### Section 6-20

- you cannot deduct as a general deduction a loss or outgoing
incurred in deriving the amount (see Division 8);

- capital gains and losses on assets used solely to produce exempt
income are disregarded (see section 118-12).

###### (3) If an amount is * non-assessable non-exempt income, it is not
###### assessable income .

Note 1: You cannot deduct as a general deduction a loss or outgoing incurred
in deriving an amount of non-assessable non-exempt income (see
Division 8).

Note 2: Capital gains and losses on assets used to produce _some_ types of
non-assessable non-exempt income are disregarded (see

##### 6-20  Exempt income

###### (1) An amount of * ordinary income or * statutory income is **_exempt_**
###### income if it is made exempt from income tax by a provision of this
###### Act or another * Commonwealth law.

For summary lists of provisions about exempt income,
see sections 11-5 and 11-15.

###### (2)  * Ordinary income is also **_exempt income_** to the extent that this Act
###### excludes it (expressly or by implication) from being assessable
###### income.

###### (3) By contrast, an amount of * statutory income is **_exempt income_** only
###### if it is made exempt from income tax by a provision of this Act
###### outside this Division or another * Commonwealth law.

###### (4) If an amount of * ordinary income or * statutory income is
* non-assessable non-exempt income, it is not **_exempt income_** .

##### Section 6-23

##### 6-23  Non-assessable non-exempt income

###### An amount of * ordinary income or * statutory income is
###### non-assessable non-exempt income if a provision of this Act or of
###### another * Commonwealth law states that it is not assessable income
###### and is not * exempt income.

Note: Capital gains and losses on assets used to produce _some_ types of

Subdivision 11-B.

##### 6-25  Relationships among various rules about ordinary income

###### (1) Sometimes more than one rule includes an amount in your
###### assessable income:

###### - ###### the same amount may be * ordinary income and may also
###### be included in your assessable income by one or more
###### provisions about assessable income; or

###### - ###### the same amount may be included in your assessable
###### income by more than one provision about assessable
###### income.

For a summary list of the provisions about assessable income,
see section 10-5.

###### However, the amount is included only once in your assessable
###### income for an income year, and is then not included in your
###### assessable income for any other income year.

###### (2) Unless the contrary intention appears, the provisions of this Act
###### (outside this Part) prevail over the rules about * ordinary income.

Note: This Act contains some specific provisions about how far the rules
about ordinary income prevail over the other provisions of this Act.

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Assessable income **Part 2-1**

Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions **Division 20**

##### Section 20-40

###### Method statement

###### Step 1. ###### Add up all the * assessable recoupments of the loss or
###### outgoing that you have received (in the * current year or
###### earlier). The result is the **_total assessable recoupment_** .

###### Step 2. ###### Add up the amounts (if any) included in your assessable
###### income for earlier income years, in respect of the loss or
###### outgoing, by this section or a * previous recoupment law.
###### The result is the **_recoupment already assessed_** . (If no
###### amount was included, the **_recoupment already assessed_** 
###### is nil.)

###### Step 3. ###### Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total
###### assessable recoupment. The result is the **_unassessed_**
###### recoupment .

###### Step 4. ###### Add up each amount that you can deduct for the loss or
###### outgoing for the * current year, or you have deducted or
###### can deduct for the loss or outgoing for an earlier income
###### year. The result is the **_total deductions for the loss or_**
###### outgoing .

Note: The total deductions may be reduced if an amount has
been included in your assessable income because of a
balancing adjustment: see section 20-45.

###### Step 5. ###### Subtract the recoupment already assessed from the total
###### deductions for the loss or outgoing. The result is the **__**
###### outstanding deductions .

###### Step 6. ###### The unassessed recoupment is included in your
###### assessable income, unless it is greater than the
###### outstanding deductions. In that case, the amount of the
###### outstanding deductions is included instead.

Example: At the start of the 2002-03 income year, a company incurs $100,000 to
start to hold a depreciating asset. The company uses the prime cost
method, and the effective life is 10 years. $10,000 is deductible for the
2002-03 income year and for each of the following 9 income years
under section 40-25.

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-1** Assessable income
**Division 20** Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions

##### Section 20-45

In the 2002-03 income year, the company receives $20,000 as
recoupment. How much is assessable for the 2002-03 income year?

Applying the method statement:

After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $20,000.

After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is nil.

After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is:
total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed,
i.e. $20,000 minus 0 = $20,000.

After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $10,000.

After step 5: the outstanding deductions are:
total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already
assessed, i.e. $10,000 minus 0 = $10,000.

After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than
outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding
deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $10,000.

Applying the method statement to the 2003-04 income year: a further
$10,000 is included in the company’s assessable income.

##### 20-45  Effect of balancing charge

###### (1) This section may affect the operation of section 20-35 or 20-40 (as
###### appropriate) if:

###### (a) a balancing adjustment is required for the * current year (or
###### for an earlier income year) because you have deducted or can
###### deduct an amount for an income year for the loss or
###### outgoing; and

###### (b) an amount (the **_balancing charge_** ) is included in your
###### assessable income for the * current year (or for the earlier
###### income year) because of the balancing adjustment.

To find out about balancing adjustments, see Subdivision 40-D.

###### Effect on section 20-35

###### (2) In applying section 20-35, treat each of the following as reduced by
###### the balancing charge:

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Assessable income **Part 2-1**

Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions **Division 20**

##### Section 20-45

###### (a) the amount of the loss or outgoing;

###### (b) the total of what you can deduct for the loss or outgoing for
###### the * current year, or have deducted or can deduct for an
###### earlier income year.

###### Effect on section 20-40

###### (3) In applying the method statement in subsection 20-40(2), reduce
###### the **_total deductions for the loss or outgoing_** by the balancing
###### charge.

Example: Continuing the example in subsection 20-40(2): at the start of the
2005-06 income year, the company:

- receives a further $10,000 as recoupment; and

- sells the depreciating asset for $75,000.

As a result of the sale, a balancing adjustment of $5,000 is included
under section 40-285 in the company’s assessable income for that
income year.

How much of the recoupment amount received in the 2005-06 income
year is assessable for that income year?

Applying the method statement in subsection 20-40(2):

After step 1: the total assessable recoupment is $30,000 (received
during 2002-03 and 2005-06).

After step 2: the recoupment already assessed is $20,000 (for 2002-03
and 2003-04).

After step 3: the unassessed recoupment is:
total assessable recoupment minus recoupment already assessed,
i.e. $30,000 minus $20,000 = $10,000.

After step 4: the total deductions for the loss or outgoing are $30,000
($10,000 for each of 2002-03, 2004-04 and 2004-05), reduced by
$5,000 (the amount included in assessable income for the balancing
adjustment), i.e. $25,000.

After step 5: the outstanding deductions are:
total deductions for the loss or outgoing minus recoupment already
assessed, i.e. $25,000 minus $20,000 = $5,000.

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-1** Assessable income
**Division 20** Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions

##### Section 20-50

After step 6: the unassessed recoupment (step 3) is greater than
outstanding deductions (step 5), so the amount of the outstanding
deductions is included in assessable income, i.e. $5,000.

##### 20-50  If the expense is only partially deductible

###### (1) This section extends the operation of section 20-35 or 20-40 (as
###### appropriate) to a case where the total of what you can deduct under
###### a provision (the **_deduction provision_** ) for a loss or outgoing is
###### limited to a proportion of the loss or outgoing.

###### (2) If you receive an * assessable recoupment of the loss or outgoing,
###### section 20-35 or 20-40 applies as if:

###### (a) you had incurred _only_ that proportion of the loss or outgoing,
###### but could deduct the _whole_ of that proportion under the
###### deduction provision; and

###### (b) you had received only that proportion of the recoupment.

Example: You incur expenditure of $500. A provision listed in section 20-30
entitles you to deduct 10% of the expenditure ($50) over 5 years. This
means you can deduct $10 in each of the 5 years.

You recoup $300 of the expenditure. This section treats you as
receiving only 10% of the recoupment. Therefore, $30 is dealt with by
section 20-40.

##### 20-55  Meaning of **_previous recoupment law_**

###### (1) **_Previous recoupment law_** means a provision of the _Income Tax_
###### Assessment Act 1936 listed in this table.

**Previous recoupment law**

**Item** **Provision**

**What kind of expense the**
**provision relates to:**

a loss or outgoing that is a
deduction

1 former **26(j)** (so far as it relates
to an amount received for or in
respect of a loss or outgoing
that is a deduction)

##### Section 20-65

###### (d) the entity that incurred the loss or outgoing receives one or
###### more amounts as * recoupment of the loss or outgoing.

###### This Subdivision (except this section and section 20-65) applies as
###### if you had incurred the loss or outgoing and had also received the
* recoupment.

##### 20-65  If 2 or more entities can deduct amounts for the loss or
##### outgoing

###### (1) Special rules apply if:

###### (a) an entity (the **_first entity_** ) incurs a loss or outgoing; and

###### (b) 2 or more entities (the **_deducting entities_** , which may include
###### the first entity) have deducted or can deduct amounts for the
###### loss or outgoing (whether for the same income year or for
###### different income years); and

###### (c) the first entity receives one or more amounts as * recoupment
###### of the loss or outgoing.

###### (2) This Subdivision (except this section and section 20-60) applies as
###### if the first entity and the deducting entities together constituted a
###### single entity (the **_notional entity_** ) that had:

###### (a) incurred the loss or outgoing; and

###### (b) received the amount or amounts as * recoupment; and

###### (c) included in its assessable income any amount included in the
###### assessable income of any of the deducting entities under a

###### (3) If because of subsection (2) the notional entity’s assessable income
###### for an income year (the **_assessment year_** ) would include an amount
###### under this Subdivision (the **_assessable amount_** ), the amount
###### reverses in the assessment year the deductions for the loss or

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-1** Assessable income
**Division 20** Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions

##### Section 20-110

#### The usual case

##### 20-110  Disposal of a leased car for profit

###### (1) Your assessable income includes the * profit you make on disposing
###### of a * car if:

###### (a) the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and

###### (b) the car was leased to you and has been leased to no-one else;
###### and

###### (c) you or another entity can deduct for the income year any of
###### the lease payments paid or payable by you, or have deducted
###### or can deduct any of them for an earlier income year, under
###### this Act; and

###### (d) you acquired the car from the lessor.

Note 1: Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may still be included
in your assessable income:

- under section 20-125 (which deals with more complicated
cases that may involve your associate); or

- if you disposed of an interest in a car (rather than the car
itself): see section 20-160.

Note 2: In some cases you do not include an amount in your assessable
income:

- if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value:
see section 20-135; or

- if you inherited the car: see section 20-145; or

- if the car was let on hire in the circumstances set out in
section 20-155.

###### (2) However, the amount included cannot exceed the smaller of these
###### limits:

###### (a) the total lease payments for the lease that you or another
###### entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an
###### income year;

###### (b) the amount of * notional depreciation for the lease period.

Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions **Division 20**

##### Section 20-115

Note 1: If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one
way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the
largest amount: see section 20-130.

Note 2: In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:

- if there has been an earlier disposal of the car, or of an interest
in it: see section 20-140; or

- if another provision requires you to include an amount because
of the disposal: see section 20-150.

###### (3) You increase those limits if you have previously leased the * car
###### from the same lessor, or from an * associate of that lessor.

###### You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each
###### previous lease of that kind that you or another entity have deducted
###### or can deduct under this Act for an income year.

###### You increase the second limit by the amount of * notional
###### depreciation for the period of each previous lease of that kind.

##### 20-115  Working out the profit on the disposal

###### (1) The **_profit_** on the disposal is the amount by which the
* consideration receivable for the disposal exceeds:

###### - ###### the amount it cost you to acquire the * car;

###### plus:

###### - ###### any capital expenditure you incurred on the car after
###### acquiring it.

###### (2) The **_consideration receivable_** is worked out using this table:

**Consideration receivable for the disposal of the car**

**Item** **In this situation:** **the consideration receivable is:**

the proceeds of the sale, less the
expenses of the sale

1 you sell the * car for an amount
specific to it

**Consideration receivable for the disposal of the car**

**Item** **In this situation:** **the consideration receivable is:**

2 you sell the * car with other
property without a specific amount
being allocated to it

the part of the total proceeds of the
sale that is reasonably attributable to
the car less the part of the reasonably

because it is lost or destroyed

###### (3) However, if the disposal of the * car is a * taxable supply, the
###### consideration receivable does not include an amount equal to the
* GST payable on the supply.

##### 20-120  Meaning of **_notional depreciation_**

###### This is how to work out the **_notional depreciation_** for a lease
###### period:

###### Method statement

###### Step 1. ###### Compare:

###### - ###### the * car’s * cost to the lessor for the purposes of
###### Subdivision 40-C (which is about working out the
###### cost of * depreciating assets);

###### with:

###### - ###### the car’s * termination value for the purposes of
###### section 40-300 when the lessor disposed of it.

Assessable income **Part 2-1**

Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions **Division 20**

##### Section 20-125

###### Step 2. ###### If the car’s cost exceeds the car’s termination value,
###### multiply the excess by:

###### - ###### the number of days in the lease period;

###### divided by:

###### - ###### the number of days the lessor owned the car.

###### Step 3. ###### The result is the **_notional depreciation_** for the lease
###### period.

###### Step 4. ###### If the car’s cost does _not_ exceed the car’s termination
###### value, the **_notional depreciation_** for the lease period is
###### zero.

Note 1: The notional depreciation for the lease period represents:

- the amount you could have deducted for the car’s decline in
value if, instead of leasing it, you had owned it and used it
solely for the purpose of producing assessable income for
that period;

adjusted by:

- the balancing adjustment you would have made if you had
disposed of the car at the end of that period.

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-1** Assessable income
**Division 20** Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions

##### Section 20-125

###### (a) section 20-110 does _not_ include an amount in your assessable
###### income because of the disposal; and

###### (b) the car was designed mainly for carrying passengers; and

###### (c) the car was leased to you or your * associate; and

###### (d) you, your associate or another entity can deduct for the
###### income year any of the lease payments paid or payable by the
###### lessee, or have deducted or can deduct any of them for an
###### earlier income year, under this Act; and

###### (e) either:

###### (i) you, your associate, or entities including you or your
###### associate, acquired the car from the lessor; or

###### (ii) another entity acquired the car from the lessor under an
* arrangement that enabled you or your associate to
###### acquire the car.

Note 1: Even if subsection (1) does not apply, an amount may be included in
your assessable income if you disposed of an interest in a car (rather
than the car itself): see section 20-160.

Note 2: In some cases you do _not_ include an amount in your assessable
income:

- if there has been an earlier disposal of the car for market value:
see section 20-135; or

- if you inherited the car: see section 20-145; or

- if the car was let on hire in the circumstances set out in
section 20-155.

###### (2) However, the amount included cannot exceed the smallest of these
###### limits:

###### (a) the total lease payments for the lease that you, your
* associate or another entity have deducted or can deduct
###### under this Act for an income year;

###### (b) the amount of * notional depreciation for the lease period;

###### (c) if an entity other than you, or if entities including you,
###### acquired the * car from the lessor—the amount by which the
* consideration receivable for the disposal of the car by you
###### exceeds the total of:

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Assessable income **Part 2-1**

Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions **Division 20**

##### Section 20-125

###### (i) the car’s cost to that entity, or those entities; and

###### (ii) any capital expenditure that entity, or any of those
###### entities, incurred on the car after that acquisition and
###### before you acquired it.

Note 1: If, because of more than one lease of the car, there is more than one
way to work out the amount to be included, you only include the
largest amount: see section 20-130.

Note 2: In some cases you reduce the amount to be included:

- if there has been an earlier disposal of the car, or of an interest
in it: see section 20-140; or

- if another provision requires you to include an amount because
of the disposal: see section 20-150.

Example: Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it from the
lessor for $4,000. Your associate sells it to you for $3,000. You sell it
for $10,000.

Your profit is $10,000 (the consideration receivable) less $3,000 (the
car’s cost to you) = $7,000.

The first 2 limits on the amount to be included in your assessable
income are $9,000 (total deductible lease payments for the lease) and
$8,000 (notional depreciation for the lease period).

Since your associate acquired the car from the lessor, the third limit is
$10,000 (the consideration receivable by you) less $4,000 (the car’s
cost to the associate) = $6,000.

The amount you include in your assessable income _cannot_ exceed the
smallest of the limits. So, you do not include your profit of $7,000.
Instead, you include $6,000 (the smallest of the limits).

###### (3) You increase the first 2 limits if you, or your associate, have
###### previously leased the * car from the same lessor, or from an
###### associate of that lessor.

###### You increase the first limit by the total lease payments for each
###### previous lease of that kind that you, your * associate or another
###### entity have deducted or can deduct under this Act for an income
###### year.

##### Section 20-130

###### You increase the second limit by the amount of * notional
###### depreciation for the period of each previous lease of that kind.

#### Successive leases

##### 20-130  Successive leases

###### If, because of 2 or more leases of the * car, there are different
###### amounts that could be included in your assessable income because
###### of the disposal, only the largest of those amounts is included.

#### Previous disposals of the car

##### 20-135  No amount included if earlier disposal for market value

###### You do _not_ include an amount in your assessable income because
###### of the disposal if, after the lessor disposed of the * car and before
###### you disposed of it, an entity other than you disposed of the car and:

###### (a) the * consideration receivable for that disposal was at least the
* market value of the car at the time of that disposal; or

###### (b) because of that disposal, that market value was included, or
###### an amount worked out using that market value was included,
###### in the entity’s assessable income under this Act.

##### 20-140  Reducing the amount to be included if there has been an
##### earlier disposal

###### Each limit on the amount to be included in your assessable income
###### because of your disposal of the * car is reduced if, after the lease

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Assessable income **Part 2-1**

Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions **Division 20**

##### Section 20-140

**Reducing each limit on the amount to be included**

**Item** **In this situation:** **reduce each limit by:**

that amount

1 Section 20-110 or 20-125 included an amount in
your assessable income in respect of such an earlier
disposal by you

that amount

2 Section 20-110 or 20-125 included an amount in
another entity’s assessable income in respect of such
an earlier disposal by the other entity

that amount

3 Section 20-110 or 20-125 would have included an
amount in your assessable income in respect of such
an earlier disposal by you but for the operation of
section 20-145

that amount

4 Section 20-110 or 20-125 would have included an
amount in another entity’s assessable income in
respect of such an earlier disposal by the other entity
but for the operation of section 20-145

the amount of the
reduction

5 Section 20-150 reduced the amount to be included in
your assessable income in respect of such an earlier
disposal by you

the amount of the
reduction

6 Section 20-150 reduced the amount to be included in
another entity’s assessable income in respect of such
an earlier disposal by the other entity

Examples: Your associate leases a car for 5 years and then acquires it. Your
associate disposes of it to you and section 20-110 includes $500 in
your associate’s assessable income.

You later dispose of the car.

In working out the amount to include in your assessable income for
your disposal, you _can_ reduce each limit in subsection 20-125(2) by
$500 because the disposal by your associate occurred _after_ the lease
period began.

Contrast this case:

You lease a car for 5 years and then acquire it. You dispose of it to
another entity and section 20-110 includes $1,000 in your assessable
income.

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-1** Assessable income
**Division 20** Amounts included to reverse the effect of past deductions

##### Section 20-145

You lease the car from that entity for 2 years and then acquire it. You
later dispose of it.

In working out the amount to include in your assessable income in
respect of the second lease, you _cannot_ reduce each limit in
subsection 20-110(2) by $1,000 because the first disposal did _not_ 
occur after the start of that lease.

Note: If the earlier disposal occurred in the 1996-97 income year or an
earlier income year, each limit may be able to be reduced by a further
amount: see section 20-115 of the _Income Tax (Transitional_
_Provisions) Act 1997_ .

#### Miscellaneous rules

##### 20-145  No amount included if you inherited the car

###### You do _not_ include an amount in your assessable income because
###### of the disposal if you inherited the * car.

##### 20-150  Reducing the amount to be included if another provision
##### requires you to include an amount for the disposal

###### The amount to be included in your assessable income because of
###### the disposal is reduced by any amount that another provision of
###### this Act (except sections 40-285 and 40-370) requires you to
###### include in your assessable income because of the disposal.

Note: sections 40-285 and 40-370 are about including an amount after
making a balancing adjustment on the disposal of a car.

##### 20-155  Exception for particular cars taken on hire

###### This Subdivision does not apply to these kinds of leases:

###### (a) letting a * car on hire under a * hire purchase agreement; or

###### (b) letting a * car on hire under an agreement of a kind ordinarily
###### entered into by people who take cars on hire intermittently on
###### an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.

###### This Subdivision does not apply to you if, at any time in the
###### income year in which you disposed of the * car, it was allocated to a
###### pool of yours under Division 328.

#### Disposals of interests in a car: special rules apply

##### 20-160  Disposal of an interest in a car

###### almost the same way as it does to the disposal of the car itself. The
###### differences are set out below.

###### (2) Your assessable income includes so much of your * profit on the
###### disposal as is reasonable. The limits in subsections 20-110(2) and
###### 20-125(2) do _not_ apply.

###### (3) The cost of the interest to you is taken to be a reasonable amount.

###### (4) Sections 20-135 and 20-140 do _not_ apply to the disposal.

Note 1: Section 20-135 says that you do not include an amount if there has
been an earlier disposal of the car for market value.

Note 2: Section 20-140 allows you to reduce the amount to be included if
there has been an earlier disposal of the car.

###### (5) Section 20-145 applies to the disposal if you inherited either the
###### interest or the * car itself.

Note: Section 20-145 says that you do not include an amount if you
inherited the car.

**Division 25** Some amounts you can deduct

##### Section 25-5

###### (b) an amount withheld or payable under Part 2-5 or Part 2-10 in
###### Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ ; or

###### (c) expenditure for * borrowing money (including payments of
###### interest) to pay an amount covered by paragraph (a) or (b); or

###### (d) expenditure for a matter relating to the commission (or
###### possible commission) of an offence against an * Australian
###### law or a * foreign law; or

###### (e) a fee or commission for advice about the operation of a
* Commonwealth law relating to taxation, unless that advice
###### is provided by a * recognised tax adviser.

###### No deduction for expenditure excluded from general deductions

###### (3) You cannot deduct expenditure under subsection (1) to the extent
###### that a provision of this Act (except section 8-1) expressly prevents
###### or limits your deducting it under section 8-1 (about general
###### deductions). It does not matter whether the provision specifically
###### refers to section 8-1.

###### No deduction for capital expenditure

###### (4) You cannot deduct capital expenditure under subsection (1).
###### However, for this purpose, expenditure is not capital expenditure
###### merely because the * tax affairs concerned relate to matters of a

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts **Part 2-5**

Some amounts you can deduct **Division 25**

##### Section 25-5

###### (b) complying with an obligation imposed on you by a
* Commonwealth law, insofar as that obligation relates to the
* tax affairs of another entity.

Example: You buy a computer to prepare your tax returns. The expenditure you
incur in buying the computer is capital expenditure and cannot be
deducted under this section.

However, to the extent that you use the computer in preparing your
income tax return, you will be able to deduct the decline in value of
your computer under Division 40. That is because, under this
subsection, the computer is property that you are taken to use for the
purpose of producing assessable income.

###### (6) If another provision of this Act expressly provides that a particular
###### use of property is not taken to be for the * purpose of producing
###### assessable income, that provision overrides subsection (5).

###### No double deduction for general interest charge on a running
###### balance account

###### (7) If you deduct * general interest charge that applies to an RBA
###### deficit debt, you can’t also deduct the corresponding general
###### interest charge on * tax debts that have been allocated to the RBA.

Note: RBAs (running balance accounts) are dealt with in Part IIB of the
_Taxation Administration Act 1953_ .

###### Expenditure by trustee of deceased estate

###### (8) If:

###### (a) after you die, the trustee of your deceased estate incurs
###### expenditure; and

###### (b) had you incurred the expenditure before you died, you could
###### have deducted it under subsection (1);

###### for the purposes of assessing the trustee for the income year in
###### which you died, the expenditure is a deduction under that
###### subsection.

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts **Part 2-5**

Some amounts you can deduct **Division 25**

##### Section 25-25

###### Property used partly for that purpose

###### (2) If you have used, or will use, the leased property only _partly_ for
###### that purpose, you can deduct the expenditure to the extent that you
###### have used, or will use, the leased property for that purpose.

##### 25-25  Borrowing expenses

###### (1) You can deduct expenditure you incur for * borrowing money, to
###### the extent that you use the money for the * purpose of producing
###### assessable income. In most cases the deduction is spread over the
* period of the loan.

For the cases where the deduction is _not_ spread, see subsection (6).

Note: Your deductions under this section may be reduced if any of your
commercial debts have been forgiven in the income year: see
Subdivision 245-E.

###### Income year when money used solely for the purpose of producing
###### assessable income

###### (2) You can deduct for an income year the maximum amount worked
###### out under subsection (4) if you use the * borrowed money during
###### that income year _solely_ for the * purpose of producing assessable
###### income.

Example: In 1997-98 you borrow $100,000 and incur expenditure of $1,500 for
the borrowing. You use the money to buy a house. Throughout
1998-99 you rent the house to a tenant. You can deduct for the
expenditure for 1998-99 the maximum amount worked out under
subsection (4).

###### Income year when borrowed money used partly for that purpose

###### (3) If you use the money only _partly_ for that purpose during that
###### income year, you can deduct the proportion of that maximum
###### amount that is appropriate having regard to the extent that you used
###### the * borrowed money for that purpose.

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-5** Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts
**Division 25** Some amounts you can deduct

##### Section 25-25

Note: You cannot deduct anything for that income year if you do not use the
money for that purpose at all during that income year.

###### Maximum deduction for an income year

###### (4) You work out as follows the maximum amount that you can deduct
###### for the expenditure for an income year:

###### Method statement

###### Step 1. ###### Work out the **_remaining expenditure_** as follows:

###### - ###### For the income year in which the * period of the
###### loan begins, it is the amount of the expenditure.

###### - ###### For a later income year, it is the amount of the
###### expenditure reduced by the maximum amount that
###### you can deduct for the expenditure for each earlier
###### income year.

###### Step 2. ###### Work out the **_remaining loan period_** as follows:

###### - ###### For the income year in which the * period of the
###### loan begins, it is the period of the loan (as
###### determined at the end of the income year).

###### - ###### For a later income year, it is the period from the
###### start of the income year until the end of the period
###### of the loan (as determined at the end of the income
###### year).

###### Step 3. ###### Divide the remaining expenditure by the number of days
###### in the remaining loan period.

###### Step 4. ###### Multiply the result from Step 3 by the number of days in

##### Section 25-25

Applying the method statement:

After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the
expenditure).

After Step 2: the remaining loan period is 4 years from 1 September
1997 (1,461 days).

After Step 3: the result is $1,500 divided by 1,461 = $1.03.

After Step 4: the result is $1.03 multiplied by 302 days = $310.06.

Suppose you repay the loan early, on 31 December 1998. What is the
maximum amount you can deduct for the expenditure for 1998-99?

Applying the method statement:

After Step 1: the remaining expenditure is $1,500 (the amount of the
expenditure) reduced by $310.06 (the maximum amount you can
deduct for 1997-98) = $1,189.94.

After Step 2: the remaining loan period is the period from 1 July 1998
to 31 December 1998 (183 days).

After Step 3: the result is $1,189.94 divided by 183 days = $6.50.

After Step 4: the result is $6.50 multiplied by 183 days = $1,189.94.

Note: Alternatively, you can deduct the expense under section 8-1 (which is
about general deductions) if you satisfy the requirements of that
section.

###### Maximum amount—$42

###### If you deduct under section 8-1

##### Section 25-65

##### 25-65  Local government election expenses

###### (1) You can deduct expenditure you incur in contesting an election for
###### membership of a * local governing body, but you cannot deduct
###### more than $1,000 per election. You deduct the expenditure for the
###### income year in which you incur it.

###### (2) However, you can deduct more than the $1,000 limit if:

###### (a) you have received an amount as * recoupment of the
###### expenditure; and

###### (b) some or all of that amount is included in your assessable
###### income for an income year; and

###### (c) the total of your deductions for the election would be less
###### than the $1,000 limit if you disregarded so much (the
###### assessed recoupment ) of the expenditure as equals the
###### amount so included in your assessable income.

###### In that case:

###### (d) the assessed recoupment is disregarded in applying the
###### $1,000 limit; and

###### (e) the further amount that you can deduct because of
###### paragraph (d) is deducted for the income year referred to in
###### paragraph (b).

Example: Chris is elected to the Bunyip Shire Council. In the 2007-08 income
year he incurs expenditure of $1,200 in contesting the election, of
which he deducts $1,000 (the limit under subsection (1)).

In 2008-09, Chris receives $360 as an assessable recoupment of the
expenditure. $300 of that is included in his assessable income by
section 20-35 (as extended by section 20-50).

Because of the assessable recoupment, $300 of the expenditure is
disregarded under paragraph (2)(d) in applying the $1,000 limit. As a
result, Chris’s deductions are treated as being only $700, which is less
than the limit. This does not affect his original deduction for
2007-2008, but it means he can deduct the previously undeducted
$200, for 2008-09 (see paragraph (2)(e)).

This triggers a further application of section 20-35 (as extended by
section 20-50) to include the remaining $60 of the assessable

###### (2) An **_accrued leave transfer payment_** is a payment that an entity

###### accrued while the entity was required to make payments in
###### respect of the individual’s leave, or leave the individual

###### It does not matter whether the leave accrues to the individual as an

**Division 26** Some amounts you cannot deduct, or cannot deduct in full

##### Section 26-47

##### 26-47  Non-business boating activities

###### Object

###### (1) The object of this section is to improve the integrity of the taxation
###### system by preventing deductions from boating activities that are
###### not carried on as a * business being offset against other assessable
###### income.

###### Rule

###### (2) This Act applies to you as if so much of the amounts relating to
###### using or * holding boats that you could otherwise deduct for an
###### income year as exceeds your assessable income from using or
###### holding boats for that year:

###### (a) were not deductible for that income year; and

###### (b) were an amount (a **_quarantined amount_** ) relating to using or
###### holding boats that you can deduct for the next income year.

Note: A quarantined amount may be reduced under subsection (5) (for boat
capital gains), reduced under subsection (7) (where you deduct part of
a quarantined amount under subsection (6) for boat business profits),
reduced under subsection (8) (about exempt income) or affected by
subsection (10) (about bankruptcy).

Example: Ian does not use his boat in a business. In Year 1, Ian would be able to
claim $100,000 in deductions for the boat (but for this subsection),
including interest, depreciation and running costs. He earns only
$40,000 of income from the boat. He can only deduct $40,000. He
carries the remaining $60,000 forward to Year 2 (the quarantined
amount).

In Year 2, Ian has $95,000 of expenses and $30,000 of income for the
boat. He can deduct $30,000. The quarantined amount is now
$125,000: the quarantined amount from Year 1 plus the excess of
expenses over income from Year 2.

In Year 3, Ian has $60,000 of expenses and $150,000 of income from
the boat. The expenses from Year 3 plus the quarantined amount is
$185,000. Therefore, Ian claims a deduction of $150,000 and carries
forward $35,000 to Year 4.

###### so much of that amount as is applied under section 118-80 to
###### reduce a * capital gain you have for the year in relation to a boat.
###### You make this reduction before you deduct an amount under
###### subsection (6).

###### Deduction if you have boat business profits

###### (6) You can deduct all or part of your remaining quarantined amount
###### for an income year if your assessable income for the year from
###### activities of a kind referred to in subsection (3) exceeds your

##### Section 28-20

#### Operative provision

##### 28-20  Rules governing choice of method

###### (1) You can choose only one method for all the * car expenses for the
* car for the income year. Choosing one method precludes the other
###### method.

###### (2) However, you can change your choice for the income year.

Example: You choose the “log book” method and deduct $1,000. On audit, the
Commissioner finds that your claim is too high and should be reduced
to $500. You would have been able to deduct $700 if you had chosen
the “cents per kilometre” method. This rule lets you change your
choice and deduct the $700.

###### (3) You can also choose different methods for the same * car for
###### different income years and different methods for different cars for
###### the same year.

###### (3) **_Business kilometres_** are kilometres the * car travelled in the course
###### of:

###### (a) producing your assessable income; or

###### You calculate the number of business kilometres by making a
###### reasonable estimate.

###### (4) For the purposes of subsection (1), the Commissioner may, by
###### legislative instrument, determine rates of cents per kilometre for
###### cars for an income year.

###### (5) In determining a rate, the Commissioner must have regard to the
###### average operating costs for the cars to be covered by that rate.

Note: Examples of operating costs include fixed costs such as registration,
insurance and depreciation, and variable costs such as fuel and
maintenance.

##### 28-30  Capital allowances

###### If a * balancing adjustment event occurs for the * car, you will need

**Part 2-5** Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts
**Division 28** Car expenses

##### Section 28-90

28-100 Substantiation

##### 28-90  How to calculate your deduction

###### (1) To use the “log book” method, you multiply the amount of each
* car expense by the * business use percentage.

###### The expense

###### (2) The expense must qualify as a deduction under some provision of
###### this Act outside this Division (or would qualify if, while you * held
###### the * car, you had used it only in producing your assessable
###### income). If only part of the expense would qualify, you multiply
###### that part by the * business use percentage.

Example: You borrow money to buy a car. You make repayments of principal
and payments of interest.

You cannot deduct the repayments of principal because they are
capital expenses.

The interest payments would be deductible in full if, throughout the
income year, you had used the car only in producing your assessable
income.

Using the “log book” method:

- if you held the car for the whole income year—multiply the
interest payments by the business use percentage;

- if you held the car for only 6 months of the income year—
multiply the interest payments for those 6 months by the
business use percentage.

To find out whether an expense qualifies as a deduction under this Act, see
Division 8 (Deductions).

###### The percentage

###### (3) The **_business use percentage_** is calculated by dividing:

- ###### the number of * business kilometres that the * car travelled
###### in the period when you * held it during the income year;

##### 28-110  Steps for keeping a log book

###### There are 3 steps you need to follow in keeping a log book:

- ###### choose a period of at least 12 weeks for the log book to
###### cover;

- ###### record journeys made in the car during the log book period
###### in the course of producing your assessable income.

#### Operative provisions

##### 28-115  Income years for which you need to keep a log book

###### (1) You need to keep a log book for the first income year for which
###### you use this method for the * car.

###### (2) Having kept a log book for one income year, you don’t need to
###### keep a new one for the next 4 or more income years unless
###### subsection (3) or (4) requires it. If you haven’t kept a new log book
###### for 4 income years in a row, you must keep one for the next
###### income year.

Example: If you keep a log book in 1997-98, you would need to keep the next
one in 2002-2003, unless subsection (3) or (4) requires one sooner.

##### Section 28-120

###### (3) You must keep a log book for an income year if the Commissioner
###### sends you a notice before the year directing you to keep a log book
###### for the * car for that year.

###### (4) You must keep a log book for an income year if, during that year,
###### you get one or more additional * cars for which you want to use the
###### “log book” method for that year.

###### (5) When you replace one * car with another, you might have a period
###### when you * hold both the new car and the old car, or a period when
###### you no longer * hold the old car but do not yet hold the new car. In
###### both these cases, you are treated for the purposes of subsection (4)
###### as if you held the one car continuously.

###### (6) You may choose to keep a log book for an income year even if you
###### don’t need to; for example, because you want to establish a higher
* business use percentage.

##### 28-120  Choosing the 12 week period for a log book

###### (1) The log book must cover a continuous period of at least 12 weeks
###### throughout which you * held the * car. If you hold the car for less
###### than 12 weeks, the period must be the entire period for which you
###### held the car.

###### (2) The period may overlap the start or end of the income year, so long
###### as it includes part of the year.

###### (3) If you want to use the “log book” method for 2 or more * cars for
###### the same income year, the log books for those cars must cover
###### periods that are concurrent.

##### 28-125  How to keep a log book

###### (1) It is in your interests to record in the log book any journey made in
###### the * car during the log book period in the course of producing your
###### assessable income. If a journey is not recorded, the log book will
###### indicate a lower * business use percentage than is actually the case.

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts **Part 2-5**

Gifts or contributions **Division 30**

##### Section 30-5

Note: Subdivision 30-DA deals with the deductibility of contributions and
gifts to political parties, independent candidates and members.

###### (2) Subdivision 30-A contains a table of all the gifts and contributions
###### that you can deduct. You need to look at the table to see whether
###### the type of gift or contribution you are making is covered by it.

###### (3) In some cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30-B. It has a
###### number of tables that list particular funds, authorities or institutions
###### that deductible gifts can be made to.

###### (4) In other cases, the table sends you off to Subdivision 30-C. It
###### contains rules that apply to particular gifts of property.

###### (4AA) Subdivision 30-BA provides for the Commissioner to endorse as a
###### deductible gift recipient an entity that is, or operates, a fund,
###### authority or institution. The relevance of the Subdivision to you is
###### that generally you can deduct only a gift you make to a recipient
###### that is endorsed or named in:

###### (a) this Division; or

###### (b) regulations made for the purposes of this Division.

Note: The fact that gifts to a recipient registered in the Australian Business
Register are deductible will be shown in the Register.

###### (4AB) Subdivision 30-CA sets out administrative rules which do not
###### directly affect whether you can deduct a gift you make. The rules
###### require:

###### (a) a receipt issued by an entity for a gift to the entity or to a
###### fund, authority or institution operated by the entity to show
###### the entity’s ABN; and

###### (b) the Australian Business Registrar to enter in the Australian
###### Business Register a statement in relation to an entity entered
###### in the Register if:

###### (i) gifts to the entity are deductible; or

###### (ii) gifts to a fund, authority or institution operated by the
###### entity are deductible.

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-5** Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts
**Division 30** Gifts or contributions

##### Section 30-215

**Amount you can deduct for a gift of property**

**Item** **In this case:** **The amount you can deduct is:**

1 Section 30-205 (which is about the
proceeds of the sale being
assessable) applies, and you bought
the property

the amount you paid for the property,
reduced by the amount of any * input
tax credit to which you are or were
entitled for your * acquisition of the
property

2 Section 30-205 (which is about the
proceeds of the sale being
assessable) applies, and you created
or produced the property

so much of the cost of creation or
production as you would have been
able to deduct if you had sold the
property, reduced by the amount of
any * input tax credit to which you are
or were entitled for your * acquisitions
to the extent that they were made for
the purpose of creating or producing
the property

3 Neither of cases 1 and 2 applies,
and you acquired the property:
(a) less than one year before making
the gift (otherwise than by
inheriting it); or

(b) for the purpose of giving it
away; or

the lesser of the amount you paid for
the property and:
(a) if the average of the written
valuations you got fairly
represents the * GST inclusive
market value (as reduced under
subsection (4) if that subsection
applies) of the property on the day
you made the gift—that average;
or

(c) subject to an * arrangement that
the property would be given
away

(b) if it does not—the * GST inclusive
market value (as reduced under
subsection (4) if that subsection
applies) of the property on the day
you made the gift

the * GST inclusive market value (as
reduced under subsection (4) if that
subsection applies) of the property on
the day you made the gift

4 None of cases 1 to 3 applies, and
the average of the written valuations
you got does _not_ fairly represent the
* market value of the property on the
day you made the gift

###### (i) does not receive immediate custody and control of the
###### property; or

###### (ii) does not have the unconditional right to retain custody
###### and control of the property in perpetuity; or

###### (iii) does not obtain an immediate, indefeasible and

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts **Part 2-5**

Entertainment expenses **Division 32**

##### Section 32-10

section.

##### 32-10  Meaning of **_entertainment_**

###### (1) **_Entertainment_** means:

###### (a) entertainment by way of food, drink or * recreation; or

###### (b) accommodation or travel to do with providing entertainment
###### by way of food, drink or * recreation.

###### (2) You are taken to provide **_entertainment_** even if business
###### discussions or transactions occur.

32-35 Seminar expenses

32-40 Entertainment industry expenses

32-45 Promotion and advertising expenses

32-50 Other expenses

##### 32-20  The main exception—fringe benefits

###### Section 32-5 does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing to the
###### extent that you incur it in respect of providing * entertainment by
###### way of * providing a * fringe benefit.

###### But this exception does not apply to the extent that the taxable
###### value of the * fringe benefit is reduced under section 63A of the
###### Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986.

Note 1: You may be able to deduct losses or outgoings that are fringe benefits
under section 51AEA, 51AEB or 51AEC of the _Income Tax_
_Assessment Act 1936_ . If you do, then you cannot deduct them under
section 8-1 (about general deductions) and so this section is not
relevant.

Note 2: There are other exceptions for a loss or outgoing you incur in
providing a benefit that would be a fringe benefit if it were not an
exempt benefit: see items 1.6 and 1.7 of the table in section 32-30.

##### 32-25  The tables set out the other exceptions

###### Section 32-5 does not stop you deducting a loss or outgoing to the
###### extent that you incur it in respect of providing * entertainment as
###### described in column 2 of an item of a table in this Subdivision.

###### However, if column 3 of that item applies, the exception in column
###### 2 of that item does not.

#### Guide to Division 35

##### 35-1  What this Division is about

###### This Division prevents losses of individuals from non-commercial
###### business activities being offset against other assessable income in

###### whether a business activity is treated as being non-commercial.

###### The deferred losses may be offset in later years against profits from
###### the activity. They may also be offset against other income if the
###### income requirement and one of the other tests are satisfied, or if the
###### Commissioner exercises a discretion.

###### (1) The object of this Division is to improve the integrity of the
###### taxation system by:

###### (a) preventing losses from non-commercial activities that are
###### carried on as * businesses by individuals (alone or in

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts **Part 2-5**

Deferral of losses from non-commercial business activities **Division 35**

##### Section 35-10

###### (b) the Commissioner has exercised the discretion set out in
###### section 35-55 for the business activity for that year; or

###### (c) the exception in subsection (4) applies for that year.

Note: This section covers individuals carrying on a business activity as
partners, but not individuals merely in receipt of income jointly.
Compare the definition of _partnership_ in subsection 995-1(1).

###### Rules

###### (2) If the amounts attributable to the * business activity for that income
###### year that you could otherwise deduct under this Act for that year
###### exceed your assessable income (if any) from the business activity
###### for that year, or your share of it, this Act applies to you as if the
###### excess:

###### (a) were not incurred in that income year; and

###### (b) were an amount attributable to the activity that you can
###### deduct from assessable income from the activity for the next
###### income year in which the activity is carried on.

Note 1: There are modifications of this rule if you have exempt income (see
section 35-15) or you become bankrupt (see section 35-20).

Note 2: This rule does not apply if your excess is solely due to deductions
under Division 41 (see section 35-10 of the _Income Tax (Transitional_
_Provisions) Act 1997_ ).

Example: Jennifer has a salaried job, and she also carries on a business activity
consisting of selling lingerie.

Jennifer starts that activity on 1 July 2002, and for the 2002-03
income year, the activity produces assessable income of $8,000 and
deductions of $10,000. The activity does not pass any of the tests and
the discretion is not exercised so the $2,000 excess is carried over to
the next income year in which the activity is carried on.

For the 2003-04 income year, the activity produces assessable income
of $9,000 and deductions of $10,000 (excluding the $2,000 excess
from 2002-03). Again, no tests passed and no exercise of discretion.

$3,000 is carried over to the next income year (comprising the $1,000
excess for the current year, plus the previous year’s $2,000 excess)
when the activity is carried on.

for a corporate tax entity that has an amount of excess franking
offsets.

###### time during the later income year.

Note 1: A tax loss can be deducted under this section only to the extent that it

##### Section 36-17

###### If the entity has net exempt income

###### (3) If the entity has * net exempt income for the later income year and
###### the entity’s total assessable income (if any) for that year exceeds
###### the entity’s total deductions (except * tax losses), the entity is to:

###### (a) first, deduct the tax loss from the net exempt income; and

###### (b) secondly, deduct from the part of the total assessable income
###### that exceeds those deductions so much of the undeducted
###### amount of the tax loss (if any) as the entity chooses.

###### The entity may choose a nil amount under paragraph (b).

Note: To work out the corporate tax entity’s net exempt income: see
section 36-20.

###### (4) However, if the entity has * net exempt income for the later income
###### year and those deductions exceed the entity’s total assessable
###### income, the entity is to:

###### (a) subtract that excess from the net exempt income; and

###### (b) deduct the * tax loss from any net exempt income that

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts **Part 2-5**

Tax losses of earlier income years **Division 36**

##### Section 36-17

###### that would result in the entity having an amount of excess
###### franking offsets for that year.

Example: For the 2017-18 income year, Company A (which is not a base rate
entity) has:

- a tax loss of $150 from a previous income year; and

- assessable income of $200 (franked distribution of $70,
franking credit of $30 and $100 of income from other
sources); and

- no deductions; and

- no net exempt income.

The tax offset of $30 from the franking credit is not stated in
Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

Company A would not have an amount of excess franking offsets for
that year if the tax loss were disregarded (see section 36-55). This is
because the tax offset of $30 is less than $60, the amount of income
tax that Company A would have to pay if it did not have the tax offset
and the tax loss. Paragraph (a) therefore does not apply.

If Company A chooses to deduct the full amount of the tax loss, it
would have an amount of excess franking offsets of $15:

######  ######  #####  #####  $30 $200 $150   

Company A therefore cannot make this choice because of
paragraph (b).

However, if Company A chooses to deduct $100 of the tax loss, it
would not have an amount of excess franking offsets:

######  ######  #####  #####  $30 $200 $    

Company A therefore can choose to deduct $100 of the tax loss.

###### (6) The entity must state its choice under subsection (2) or (3) in its
* income tax return for the later income year.

###### General

###### (7) If the entity has 2 or more * tax losses, the entity is to deduct them
###### in the order in which the entity incurred them.

###### whether or not the amount is recalculated in an amendment of the
###### entity’s assessment for that year, and whether or not the amount
###### was a nil amount before the recalculation (or has become a nil
###### amount after the recalculation).

###### (11) If:

###### (a) before the recalculation, a choice under subsection (2) or (3)
###### for the income year was not available to the entity; but

###### (b) as a result of the recalculation, the choice has (apart from
###### subsection (6)) become available to the entity;

###### the entity can make that choice by written notice given to the
###### Commissioner.

###### (12) If:

###### (a) the entity made a choice under subsection (2) or (3) for the
###### income year; but

###### (b) as a result of the recalculation, the entity wishes to change
###### that choice;

###### the entity can do so by written notice given to the Commissioner.

###### (13) Subsections (10) to (12) have effect subject to section 170 of the

Liability rules of general application **Chapter 2**

Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts **Part 2-5**

Tax losses of earlier income years **Division 36**

##### Section 36-55

###### exceeds:

###### (b) the amount of income tax that the entity would have to pay
###### on its taxable income for that year if:

###### (i) it did not have those tax offsets; and

###### (ii) it did not have any tax offsets that are subject to the tax
###### offset carry forward rules or the refundable tax offset
###### rules; and

###### (iii) it did not have any tax offset under section 205-70;

###### but had all its other tax offsets.

###### The excess is the amount of **_excess franking offsets_** .

Note: Division 65 sets out the tax offset carry forward rules. Division 67 sets
out which tax offsets are subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

Example: For the 2017-18 income year, Company E (which is not a base rate
entity) has:

- assessable income of $200 (franked distribution of $140 and
franking credit of $60); and

- $100 of deductions that are allowable.

The tax offset of $60 from the franking credit is not stated in
Division 67 to be subject to the refundable tax offset rules.

Disregarding the tax offset of $60 from the franking credit, the amount
of income tax that Company E would have to pay is $30:

######  ######  #####  #####  $140 $60 $    

This amount is $30 less than the tax offset of $60. Company E
therefore has an amount of excess franking offsets of $30 for that
year.

###### How to work out the amount of the tax loss

###### (2) For the purposes of this Act, if:

###### (a) an entity has an amount of * excess franking offsets for an
###### income year; and

###### (b) the result of applying the following method statement is a
###### positive amount;

###### then:

**Chapter 2** Liability rules of general application
**Part 2-5** Rules about deductibility of particular kinds of amounts
**Division 36** Tax losses of earlier income years

##### Section 36-55

###### (c) the entity is taken to have a * tax loss for that year equal to
###### that positive amount (instead of an amount of tax loss worked
###### out under section 36-10, 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30); and

###### (d) that year is taken to be a * loss year for the entity if the entity
###### would not otherwise have a tax loss for that year.

###### Method statement

###### Step 1. ###### Work out the amount (if any) that would have been the
###### entity’s * tax loss for that year under section 36-10,
###### 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30 if the entity’s * net exempt
###### income for that year (if any) were disregarded.

Note: See section 36-20 for the calculation of net exempt
income.

###### Step 2. ###### Divide the amount of * excess franking offsets by the
###### entity’s * corporate tax rate for imputation purposes for
###### that year.

###### Step 3. ###### Add the results of steps 1 and 2.

###### Step 4. ###### Reduce the result of step 3 by the entity’s * net exempt
###### income for that year (if any).

###### The result of this step is taken to be the entity’s * tax loss
###### for that year. However, if the result of this step is nil or a
###### negative amount, the company does not have any tax loss
###### for that year.

Example: Assume that company E did not derive any exempt income for the
2017-2018 income year and that it would not otherwise have any tax
loss for that year under section 36-10, 165-70, 175-35 or 701-30.

Applying the method statement, the amount of excess franking offsets
of $30 generates a tax loss of $100 for that year, which can be
deducted in a later income year under section 36-15 or 36-17.
