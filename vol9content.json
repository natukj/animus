However, the gaining entity can be any\n\nkind of entity, including an individual.\n\n\n\n(3) This Division does not apply if entities deal with each other at\n\narm\u2019s length, or provide economic benefits in return for full market\n\nvalue.\n\n\n\n(4) The losing entity and the gaining entity must be connected by\n\nhaving had the same ultimate controller. In the case of closely held\n\nentities, they may instead be connected by having had a high level\n\nof common ownership.\n\n\n\n(5) The only interests affected are those owned by entities involved in\n\nthe indirect value shift or by their associates.\n\n\n\n_____________________________________\n\n*To find definitions of asterisked terms, see the Dictionary, starting at section 995-1.\n\n\n\n_50_ _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_\n\n\n\nCompilation No. 248 Compilation date: 01/01/2024 Registered: 15/01/2024\n\n\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nValue shifting Part 3-95\n\n\n\nIndirect value shifting affecting interests in companies and trusts, and arising from\n\nnon-arm\u2019s length dealings Division 727\n\n\n\n##### Section 727-25\n\n\n\n(6) There are a range of exclusions, such as:\n\n\n\n(a) exclusions for minor indirect value shifts; and\n\n\n\n(b) a series of rules designed to provide safe harbour treatment\n\nfor common transactions relating to services; and\n\n\n\n(c) anti-overlap provisions to prevent double-counting.\n\n\n\n(7) Rules of thumb are included to make it easier to determine the\n\nmarket value of some kinds of economic benefits.\n\n\n\n(8) To reduce compliance costs for:\n\n\n\n(a) *small business entities; and\n\n\n\n(b) entities that meet the CGT small business net asset threshold\n\n($6 million);\n\n\n\ninterests owned by those entities are not affected by this Division.\n",
