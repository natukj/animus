It begins at **_start time_** , when you begin to use theasset (or when you have it installed ready for use). Itcontinues while you use the asset (or have it installed).Usually, the owner of a depreciating asset **_holds_** theasset and can therefore claim deductions for its declinein value. Sometimes the economic owner will bedifferent to the legal owner and the economic ownerwill be the holder.Subdivision 40-C1.2 _Cost_The **_cost_** __ of a depreciating asset includes both:- expenses you incur to start holding the asset; and- additional expenses that contribute to its presentcondition and location (e.g. improvements).Subdivision 40-D1.3 _Balancing adjustments_When you stop holding a depreciating asset you mayhave to include an amount in your assessable income,or deduct an amount under a **_balancing adjustment_** .The adjustment reconciles the decline with the actualchange in value.Subdivision 40-E1.4 _Low-value and software development pools_Low-cost assets and assets depreciated to a low valuemay be placed in a **_low value pool_** , which is treated as asingle depreciating asset.
