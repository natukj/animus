Christmas - New Year period and will require Employees to take some annual leave
at this time. The actual close down and resumption dates for each Project will be
agreed between the _Company_ and the affected _Employees. The balance of an_
_Employee's accrued entitlements should be taken at mutually convenient times and_
managed in a way that limits the accrued annual leave to 6 weeks.

In the event Employees are required to work through the normal Christmas – New
Year period, agreement will be reached on an alternate break that achieves a
meaningful period of holiday.

Where an Employee has accrued more than 8 weeks’ leave (10 weeks leave for
shiftworkers), the excessive leave actual provisions of the Award will apply.

Where an _Employee_ wishes to cash out annual leave, this will be permitted in
accordance with clause 25.7 of the _Parent Award. Under the_ _Parent Award, this_
includes the following provisions:

-  The payment in respect of the cashing out, must not be less than the amount
that would have been payable had the Employee taken the leave at the time
the payment is made;

-  An agreement to cash out annual leave must not result in the Employee’s
remaining accrued entitlement to paid annual leave being less than 4 weeks;

-  The maximum amount of accrued paid annual leave that may be cashed out in
any period of 12 months is 2 weeks; and

-  Each cashing out of a particular amount of paid annual leave must be by a
separate agreement in writing between the Employee and the Company.

During a period of annual leave an Employee will receive in addition to their Base Rate
of pay and daily fares allowance, a loading of 17.5% calculated on the Employee’s
normal Base Rate of pay. The loading prescribed above will also apply to the
payment of annual leave on termination of employment (where applicable).

**5.2** **Time Off In Lieu (TOIL)**

A weekly hired Employee and the Company may agree to the Employee taking time off


-----

instead of payment for overtime (TOIL), in accordance with the following clause.

The minimum amount of TOIL that be accrued is 50% of the overtime hours worked, with
the maximum amount being 100% of overtime hours worked.

**Example: If an Employee works 4 hours of overtime, the Employee can elect to either:**

(a) be paid for 2 hours of overtime and accrue 2 hours of TOIL or,

(b) accrue 4 hours of TOIL.

TOIL will accrue at the rate that is applicable to the overtime hours that are being worked.

**Example: An Employee who works 4 hours overtime will be entitled to, 2 hours at time and**
a half which is 3 hours of TOIL and 2 hours at double time which is 4 hours of TOIL, being a
total of 7 hours of TOIL accrued.

TOIL must be Taken:

a) At a mutually agreed time between the Employee and the Company; and

b) Within a period of six (6) months after the overtime is worked. Otherwise, payment
for the overtime must be made to the Employee at the applicable overtime rate in
the next pay period after that six (6) month period.

An Employee may request to be paid overtime for any accrued entitlement to take TOIL. If

such a request is made, the Company must pay the Employee for the overtime at the  overtime
rate in the next pay period following the request. The maximum amount of TOIL that be accrued
is 38 hours. Where an Employee accrues more than 38 hours of TOIL, the amount of TOIL
accrued above 38 hours must either be paid to the Employee at the applicable overtime rate, or
taken as TOIL.

Any TOIL accrued upon termination must be paid out at the applicable overtime rate to the
overtime worked.

Any request for TOIL must be made in writing from the Employee and the Company must
keep records of overtime worked, accrued and taken as TOIL.

**5.3** **Personal / Carer’s Leave**

_Employees are entitled to personal/carer's leave (including sick leave) in accordance_
with the NES.

_Employees will accrue 10 days’ personal/carer's leave entitlement per annum. Paid_

With the exception of Casual Employees, all Employees covered by this Agreement
shall be engaged as weekly hire Employees.

hourly rates prescribed in Appendix 1 plus a loading of 25 percent which shall be in
lieu of all annual leave, paid personal/carer's leave, paid community service leave,

-----

**6.3** **Conditions of Employment**

An Employee classified in accordance with this Agreement is required to perform all
tasks within that level of the appointed position. This will also include tasks that are
incidental to the main function of the appointed position, and may include duties
suitable to an Employee’s classification level.

**6.4** **Qualifications, Licences and Tickets**

The Employee must maintain and renew qualifications, licences and tickets that are
required to perform the work for which the Employee is engaged for.

The Employee will notify the Company immediately where the Employee's licence is
suspended or cancelled or they are disqualified from holding or obtaining an
appropriate qualification or licence. Where it is a condition of employment to hold a
valid licence, a suspended, cancelled or disqualified may result in termination of
employment where alternative duties are not reasonably possible.

**6.5** **Supplementary Labour**

The Parties recognise that the fluctuating requirements of the business necessitate the
use of labour provided by external companies to supplement the Employee group.
Supplementary labour is likely to be used to overcome requirements caused by these
peaks in demand, skills shortages, specific Project requirements and situations when
_Employees take leave or are absent._

From time to time, the Company will need to engage labour hire contractors to provide
on hire workers to cover short term requirements. Such requirements may include
absences due to leave, start-ups, peak workloads, emergencies and unforeseen
shortages of labour.

Whilst the Company may engage supplementary labour for a variety of reasons, the
_Company acknowledges that it is not its intention to use supplementary labour to_
undermine the terms and conditions of Employees under this Agreement.

The use of supplementary labour will be reviewed at regular
Meetings between the company and union representatives.

The Consultative Committee will consult to monitor that:

-  Engagement of supplementary labour exceeding 10 weeks’ continuous service
is reviewed; and

-  The necessity of maintaining existing supplementary labour is assessed (noting
the Company’s intention is not to use supplementary labour to undermine the
employment security of Employees).

Where a labour hire contractor is engaged to provide on hire workers who perform
work that would otherwise be performed by Employees, the Company will ensure that
those workers are provided with all their lawful entitlements due in relation to their
performance of work.

Nothing in this clause requires, has the effect of requiring, or purports to require or
have the effect of requiring; or permits, has the effect of permitting or purports to permit

approval from work during such period will be deemed to have abandoned
employment and will not be entitled to payment for that period.

-  By agreement, the periods of notice in the table above can be varied provided
they do not contravene the NES.

Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of the Company to dismiss an Employee
without notice for serious misconduct or refusal of duty.
